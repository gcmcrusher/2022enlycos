Extract gold from its ore has a long history in our human history, which can be dating back to sometime around BC. And we may still remember some notable Gold Rushes in recent centuries. In the modern mining industry, washing and extracting gold is not a oneoff process. It needs some significant washing process and steps, and it's

Gold refining is a group of processes to pull out and set the precious metal apart from recycled elements (such as electronics and jewelry), mined materials, etc. The two most popular refining techniques to extract pure gold include the Wohlwill process and the Miller process.. Whereas the Miller process produces around 99.5% of pure gold, the Wohlwill process has managed to enhance the purity

Extraction of gold and other precious metals from their ores by treatment with mercury is called amalgamation. Gold dissolves in aqua regia, a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, and in sodium or potassium cyanide. The latter solvent is the basis for the cyanide process that is used to recover gold from lowgrade ore.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. This trickles slowly through the ore dissolving copper to form copper sulfate. To extract aluminum, the bauxite ore is first crushed, then mixed with lime, hot water and soda ash.
