1950s. In 1950, the jet mill was invented.The Jet Pulverizer Company, Inc. was awarded one of the original patents for jet energy milling equipment, an instrument which has now evolved into the MicronMaster® mill. In a jet mill, the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the mill by jets of air or steam. No grinding media are involved.

Lens Improvement. Later in the 16th century, Anton van Leeuwenhoek began polishing and grinding lenses when he discovered that certain shaped lenses increased an image's size. The glass lenses that he created could enlarge an object many times. The quality of his lenses allowed him, for the first in history, to see the many microscopic animals, bacteria and intricate detail of common objects.
