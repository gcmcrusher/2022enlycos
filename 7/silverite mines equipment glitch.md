Yeah it's a well known bug of Awakening. To fix it you'll have to load a game prior to entering the Silverite Mines, and go in it naked. If you don't have a save before the mines well you're screwed. Cloud_47 11 years ago #3. It's a bug, so unless you restart the mine from a previous save before getting captured your gear is lost.

So be warned. When you enter Silverlite Mine all your gear is taken away from you as a plot mechanic. You get your gear back by escaping prison and fighting 3 enemies to get 3 sets of gear back. The last set of gear (main player char) and the misc inventory items are supposed to reside in a chest right outside of the room where the final boss is.

Got hit with the glitch, If you come out of prison with all of your inventory minus what you had equipped still in your possession then you got hit with the glitch. One way to full proof this for now is to remove your main character's equipment no matter what, that way if the game proceeds normally it won't matter too much since the experiment that normally wears it will be one of the last.

I already made one walktrough in which I din't had this bug. Also my backpack was not dragged to the chest next to the qunari merchant ?!?

So when, after about 45 mins of walking around the Silverite Mines looking for my Warden's equipment, I googled to see what was I missing I see that my equipment is just permanently gone. Been trying for the last couple hours to get the console to work to just give myself back my equipment because starting completely over is not gonna happen.

The worst bug is probably the Silverite Mine's tendency to eat your equipment. Keep a save before entering, and if any of your party does not wake up wearing basic clothing, reload and adjust their equipment until it works. You can't import any save into Origins hence the name. The expected order is Origins, Awakening, Golems, Witch Hunt.
