## Common Types of Spiral Classifier Used in the Mineral Processing
The high dam classifier is more suitable for the coarse particles (larger than 0.15mm), which is often used in the first stage grinding. The submerged spiral classifier is more suitable for the overflow products (less than 0.15mm) because of stable classifying surface, high overflow output and fine particle size, which is often used as combined
