The official weight for the Challenge Gravel Grinder 700×42 is 425g. The office scales reported 428g and 427g for our test pair, which isn't shabby for such a chubby tyre.

This 18 mile ride around Sugarloaf Mountain takes advantage of most of the gravel roads in the area. It has approximately 8.4 miles of gravel roads and 9.6 of paved roads. Also about 1,200 ft of climbing. The only real climb is on Park Mills rd. It is short but kinda steep, sorta sucks when you are out of shape.
