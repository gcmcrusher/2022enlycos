## The Evolution of Sublevel Caving at Trojan Mine, Bindura, Zimbabwe, J.
In the Zimbabwe mining industry reaction to technological change, mechanisation and advancement have been relatively slow, due to isolation and economic constraints, compared to the rest of the world. Economic difficulties prevail, with high inflation levels, a poor exchange rate, lack of foreign currency and other associated problems.

## How to Find Old Abandoned Mines Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
Abandoned mines are a recurring problem for today's mining industry. In coal, metal, and nonmetal mining they pose a safety hazard if current workings intercept them; and if they are circumvented, large amounts of recoverable resources may be unnecessarily left in the ground. The problem of delineating the boundaries of these old mines is
