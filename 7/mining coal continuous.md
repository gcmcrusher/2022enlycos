Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production.

Room and pillar mining leaves pillars, or blocks, of coal behind. Continuousmining machines are used to remove the coal. As the machine breaks the coal, large arms gather the coal on a conveyor belt. The conveyor belt then carries the coal away from the seam, and it is loaded into shuttle cars. The mining machine is then moved to the next area

Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut up to around 20 feet (6 meters). This may be increased with MSHA permission. In South Africa, the limit may be as high as 12 meters or roughly 40 ft.

Before implementing a continuous mining system, mining companies must divide each mine into 20 to 30 coal beds. Then, workers must install support systems to prevent the mine from collapsing. After carving work areas into the coal beds, mining teams can begin setting up continuous miners to extract coal.
