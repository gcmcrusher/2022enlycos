## Size Reduction an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The size of the milling media (typically 20:1 for ball:powder diameter) also influences size, morphology and microstructure of the powder. To produce fine powders, it is recommended to mill in several steps while reducing successively the milling media size, as one milling step usually induces a particle size reduction of about factor 10.
