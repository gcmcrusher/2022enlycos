Many important metals are present in nature combined with sulfur as metal sulfides; these include cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, silver, and zinc. In addition, gold and platinum group metals are associated with sulfidic base metal ores. The extraction of metals from their ores has been an essential factor in the creation and

## 4 Nickel Sulfide Froth Flotation Processes and 2 Common Reagents
Nickel sulfide ore generally contains copper, so it can also be called coppernickel sulfide ore. This type of ore is mostly magmamelted coppernickel ore. When the nickel content is above 3%, it is called rich ore and can be directly smelted. When the nickel content is less than 3%, it needs to be purified by beneficiation method. At present, the most common method is flotation.

Here are four processes used in the froth flotation process of coppernickel sulfide ore. 1. Differential flotation or partial differential flotation process. When the content of copper is much more than nickel in the ore, this process can be used to separate the copper as the single concentrate. The advantage of this process is that the copper

Xanthate Application in Copper Froth Flotation. In the flotation process of copper ore, xanthate mainly reacts with Cu2. Therefore, when processing minerals containing more Cu2 on the surface, the effect of xanthate is stronger, and the order of its action is: Cu2S > CuS > Cu5FeS4 > CuFeS2. 4.
