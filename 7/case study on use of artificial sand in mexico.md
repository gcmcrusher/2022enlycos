## Nature Could Help Prevent $50 Billion in Flood Damages in the Gulf of 
In the Gulf of Mexico, our study shows that naturebased or green solutions are particularly cost effective in comparison to most 'gray' solutions. In fact, largescale oyster and wetland restoration projects, could help avert more than 45 percent of the climate risk over a 20year period in the Gulf, saving more than $50 billion in flood
