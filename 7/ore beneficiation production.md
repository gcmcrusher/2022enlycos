## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the highgrade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of lowgrade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

The ore beneficiation plant is a process that improves the ore grade of useful minerals. It based on the physical and chemical properties of different minerals in the ore, to obtain the raw materials required for smelting or other industries. Firstly, the ore is crushed by a crusher and ground by a ball mill 150 200 mesh.
