The cutting speed of a milling cutter is its circumferential linear motion that results from rotation. It is expressed in meters per minute. The cutting speed can be obtained from the formula: where, v = it is the speed of the cutter in m per min. d = cutter diameter in mm. n = Speed of the cutter in r.p.m.

The critical speed of ball mill is given by, n c = 1 2 π g R − r. where R = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. For R = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. But the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. Therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed. If 100 mm dia balls are replaced by 50 mm dia balls

The torque arm formula was the predominant theory (Hogg and Fuerstenau 1972; Guerrero and Arbiter 1960; Hlungwani et al. 2003). The torque needed to sustain the offset of the center of gravity of the charge from the mill center was being refined in many ways.
