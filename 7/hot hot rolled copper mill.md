Larger rollingslab weights, made available by the progressive introduction of continuouscasting techniques in copper and copper alloy foundries, have produced a new generation of hot mills capable of producing individual coil weights up to 9000 kg weight.

Mild Steel Plate Hot Rolled. Mild Steel Plate Hot Rolled Plate is a flat shaped plate of hot rolled mild steel. Hot rolled steel is formed through a metal rolling process where the steel is pressed at temperatures above the its recrystallization threshold. This makes the steel easier to form, and results in products that are easier to work with.

## What is Pickling and Oiling? Metal Supermarkets
Hotrolled steels often have mill scale that needs to be removed. Once pickling removes the mill scale, the steel is very susceptible to flash rusting because of its exposed surface. Oiling after pickling prevents this. Pickling and oiling helps prevent copper from forming a green copper oxide layer.
