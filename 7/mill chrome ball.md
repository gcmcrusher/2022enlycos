## Chrome Balls VS Steel Balls Grinding & Classification Circuits 
I think in ball mills you can use steel balls which are very resistant to wear rates, but in SAG mills its tricky as the accumulation of small steel balls due to low wear rate in the mill will affect so much your power draw, meaning that your power draw will be high whilst grinding efficiency is reduced as in SAG mills you need larger steel balls, this will cause a reduction in throughput.
