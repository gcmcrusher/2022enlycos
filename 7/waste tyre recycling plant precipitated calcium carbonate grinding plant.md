1. Introduction. Disposal of industrial byproducts is becoming an increasingly serious constraint on many industries. Gypsum waste (CaSO 4 ⋅2H 2 O) is a calciumrich solid residue generated in the mining industry as a result of the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD). Acidic water is naturally generated by the weathering of sulphide minerals that are exposed to atmospheric conditions

In the case of waste concrete, it produces precipitated calcium carbonate, a commodity.We propose an indirect, aqueous process consisting of six steps: (i) recovery of waste cement (primarily calcium silicate hydrate) from waste concrete, (ii) leaching of calcium from waste cement using

Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) production requires consistent quicklime quality to produce a quality carbonate. The precipitated calcium carbonate production process consists of decarbonating limestone, which separates the CaO (calcium oxide) and CO 2 (carbon dioxide). Precipitated calcium carbonate is produced by slaking highcalcium quicklime to create a lime slurry that is then

## Specialty Minerals Minerals Precipitated Calcium 
PCC stands for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate—also known as purified, refined or synthetic calcium carbonate. It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate, such as limestone, marble and chalk: CaCO3. The calcium, carbon and oxygen atoms can arrange themselves in three different ways, to form three different calcium carbonate minerals.

Limestone is subjected to high temperatures to strip carbon dioxide and produce calcium oxide. This calcination process is performed in a kiln, but the type of technology depends on the feed size of your raw material. A shaft kiln typically handles limestone between 20 mm and 175 mm in size. Stones go through preheating, heating, and cooling as

Waste cement refers to the fine fraction recovered during the recycling of waste concrete as a coarse aggregate. It disproportionately contains the calcium silicate hydrate (3CaO·2SiO 2 ·3H 2 O) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) associated with cement, which both directly carbonate to calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) (Iizuka, 2006).

Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is used in applications where, for example, higher brightness or a narrow particle size distribution is required. Carbon dioxide for PCC manufacturing is in general taken from cleaned flue gases of industries located nearby the PCC plant, thus reducing the CO2 emissions from this specific source. However
