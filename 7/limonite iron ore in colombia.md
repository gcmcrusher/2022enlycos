Iron Ore. Iron ore is an unrefined iron, a native compound of iron (as hematite, limonite, magnetite, siderite, goethite, and the bog and clay iron ores) from which the metal may be profitably extracted. The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel.
