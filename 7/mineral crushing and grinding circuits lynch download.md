The size to which particles are reduced is governed by three criteria: the particle size of the mineral grains in an ore which are to be liberated for later separation and collection into a concentrate; and. the exposure of mineral grains for dissolution by a leaching process which is to follow.

## Mineral Processing Design and Operation: An Introduction
The subject of mineral processing has been treated on the basis of unit processes that are subsequently developed and integrated to form a complete strategy for mineral beneficiation. Unit processes of crushing, grinding, solidliquid separation, flotation are therefore described in some detail so that a student at graduate level and operators
