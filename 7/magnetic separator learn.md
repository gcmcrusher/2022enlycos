## A Guide to Magnetic Separation Eclipse Magnetics
A magnetic separator applies basic magnetic principles to remove ferrous based and paramagnetic metals from a range of substances including powders, granules, liquids, pellets or pastes. They are usually installed within the product stream at key HACCP or inspection points. See our guide to selecting the right Magnetic Separator.

This cell separation technique utilizes the potential to label cell surface markers with magnetic bead–tagged antibodies and the ability of a magnetic field to migrate the labeled particles from a distance. 1 This controlled migration by a magnetic force (magnetophoresis) is invaluable in separating heterogeneous cell populations and is the basis for magneticactivated cell sorting (MACS).
