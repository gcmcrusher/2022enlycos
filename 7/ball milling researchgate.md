## Digital twin for CNC machine tool: modeling and using strategy
When CNC milling machine is cutting materials, the main forces of ball screw are axial cutting force, friction, and acceleration or deceleration impact. Working conditions of ball screw are diverse, so regular maintenance usually cannot fully guarantee reliable running. The lead screw and bearing of feed system are normally encountered failure.
