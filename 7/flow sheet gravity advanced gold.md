## FLOWSHEET DEVELOPMENT FOR GOLD OREBODIES SGS
Many modern gold plants incorporate gravity circuits as part of their overall flowsheet, and it is estimated that about 10% of the new gold produced each year is recovered by this technique. The advantages and disadvantages of gravity separation are similar to heap leaching. It is a very simple and low cost process, but gold recovery is usually low

The processing flow sheet includes: two stage crushing, milling, gravity concentration, carbon in leach (CIL) and filtering the circuit tails for dry stacking in the tails storage facility. Gold is recovered in the San Albino circuit using both gravity concentration and whole ore cyanide leaching using a standard CIL circuit.

## How to do a Mass Balance in Spreadsheet Excel
After the flow sheet has be constructed the second step is to establish what, components or parameters are to be included in the mass balance. These parameters are divided into 2 groups for conveyance: masses and secondary parameters. Secondary parameters are those parameters which are derived from masses. The second task is that of selecting
