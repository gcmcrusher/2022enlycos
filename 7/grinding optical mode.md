## Surface Roughness Generation Mechanism of Ultraprecision Grinding of 
There are 3 grinding modes in the grinding of optical glasses: the fracture mode, ductile and fracture mode, and ductile mode [3]. The surface roughness strongly depends upon the grinding mode. Ductile mode grinding of NbFl optical glass can be obtained by using a resinoidbonded wheel having diamond grains less than 2OPm in grain size.

Grinding is one of the most important processes to manufacture hardbrittle materials such as optical glass. It is often desired to increase the material removal rate while maintaining the desired surface quality. The success of this approach relies on the better understanding of the relationship between the grinding modes and the characteristics of surface and subsurface integrities.
