Refining Iron Ore. Pitcrushing machines pulverize the ore and separate the iron from impurities such as sand and clay. The best grades of ore contain close to 70% iron and usually require less processing. Lowergrade ores may require further refining methods known as beneficiation: Further crushing and washing the ores to remove more sand and clay

C O2 → CO2. The heat produced by this reaction is the main source of heat in the blast furnace that is used for iron production. At the bottom of the furnace, the temperature is very high, which causes more of the coke to react with carbon dioxide, producing carbon monoxide. C CO2 → 2CO. The carbon monoxide then becomes the "reducing

The largest development in the ironore industry, using magnetic concentration, is at the plants of Witherbee, Sherman & Co. at Mineville, N. Y., where about 1,200,000 tons of crude ore were mined and separated in 1916. The dry process of separation is used. The separate determinations of iron as magnetite, and total iron, were made so that

For iron ore, the gravity separation method is mainly used to separate weakly magnetic iron ore. There are two applications: one is that the geological grade of the ore deposit is high (about 50%), but the ore body is thin or there are many interlayers. Waste rock is mixed in during mining to dilute the ore.
