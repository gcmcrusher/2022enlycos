Cement is a broad term for several types of materials with adhesive properties. Most people are familiar with the cement used in concrete, but other types of cement are used as mortar, on PVC pipes, or for flexible items like tarps.Certain types of cement are often confused with concrete, but this type of cement is in fact a component of concrete, the material that, with water, holds the

## What are the Types and Uses of Lime in Construction?
Different types of limes used in construction are Quick Lime, Slaked Lime, Fat Lime and Hydraulic Lime. They are obtained by the process of calcination of natural limestone over a temperature of 900degree Celsius. Every form of lime is highly versatile and is used in environmental, construction, chemical and metallurgical industries.
