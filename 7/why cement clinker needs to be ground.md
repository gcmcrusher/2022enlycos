Cement production is a highly energyintensive process. Cement making consists of three major process steps: raw material preparation, clinker making in the kiln, and cement making. Raw material preparation and cement making are the main electricityconsuming processes, whereas the clinker kiln uses nearly all of the fuel in a typical cement plant.

The result is called clinker, which are rounded nodules between 1mm and 25mm across. The clinker is ground to a fine powder in a cement mill and mixed with gypsum to create cement. The powdered cement is then mixed with water and aggregates to form concrete that is used in construction.

We need to pay close attention to the particle size distribution of the ground clinker component, starting with the elimination of clinker particles with diameters greater than 30μm. Particles larger than 30μm will not react fully and thus do not add as much to the strength of concrete as an equivalent weight of smaller particles.

Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
