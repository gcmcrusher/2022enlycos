## Ground Collapse: Old mines and prospects and sinkholes NC
Building above an abandoned mine can be dangerous if the mine is weak or near the ground surface. On Feb. 18, 2000, a collapse hole developed in the front yard of a house in Cabarrus County (Figure 21). The hole was above the old Phoenix Gold Mine, which closed in 1906. In the 1980s a suburban golf course community was built over the mine.

Limestone quarries, the dark rectangular shapes just west of the urban areas, provide about half of the rock used in Florida's construction. In this part of Florida, groundwater is very near the surface. So as the rock is mined, the quarry pits fill with water. These lakes range from 30 to 50 feet deep and cover a total of about 4,900 acres.

Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into lowmagnesium and highmagnesium
