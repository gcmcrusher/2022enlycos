## Flexicone technology for sulfide ores flexicone
For the processing of goldbearing refractory and sulphide ores and concentrates, Flexicone has developed a unique beneficiation technology. The technology includes grinding and a fast process of complete oxidation of sulfides without the use of high temperatures and with minimal energy consumption. In addition, there is no need for ultrafine

## Development of a laboratory test to characterise the behaviour of free 
Today, coarse free gold is usually recovered in batch or semicontinuous gravity devices, such as Knelson or Falcon brand batch centrifugal concentrators (BCCs), an example of which is shown in Fig. 1.Gravity recoverable gold, or GRG, is a specific term which refers to free gold reporting to the concentrate stream with a small mass yield if separations are performed using BCCs.

I have high sulfide ore from Colorado, I roasted my cons for 3hrs, I ran a magnet thru the cons, I mixed 40g of my ore with 120g of standard flux from Action Mining. Heated my oven to 1900 degrees, let it there for 30 minutes. Than poured it into a cone mold, out pops the lead button, I broke off the glass and put the lead in the Kepel at 1750

Gravity concentration was achieved with pinched sluices and 76cm Knelson bowls, with a significant increase in fine gold recovery. Again, the first material fills the rings completely. At this point, any similarity in the two centrifugal type concentrators begins to separate as the unit greatly enhances and improves the centrifugal factors.
