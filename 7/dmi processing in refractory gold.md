The BIOX process. The BIOX® process for the treatment of refractory gold concentrates has been in commercial operation for 35 years following the commissioning of the first plant at the Fairview Gold Mine in South Africa in 1986. To date, 12 successful BIOX plants have been constructed in 10 countries, with the 13th nearing completion in Zimbabwe.

At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bioleach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost

Gold's resistance to oxidation is a critical point of most refining and extraction methods, and the roasting process is no exception. During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the
