The flexural strength of concrete was reported to increase by 14 and 21% when quarry dust and waste foundry sand were used at the mass proportion of 70:30 and 80:20, respectively. The quarry dust and waste foundry sand's mass proportion of 80:20 had been defined as the optimal combination ratio for best flexural strength performance.

Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

Sand is one of the important part in construction. The mining of sand also causes environmental problems which can affect the habitats and environment. The demand of sand makes the problem become very worst. To overcome this problem, partial replacement of sand can be done to reduce the amount of sand. In many country, quarry dust may become as the alternative choice to replace the sand.

## Partial Use of stone dust in concrete as an alternative of sand
Crusher stone dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand. Crusher stone dust is produced during crushing of stones into aggregates of desired size say 10mm, 20mm etc. These dusts are generally used in making blocks or land filling. It has potential to be used as partial replacement of natural river sand in concrete.

investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust. Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete quarry dust (M 20, AND M25). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%, 40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties.

Answer (1 of 4): I'm not an authority on this subject, but here are some thoughts. That depends upon what the quarry dust is. If it has minerals that will react with the cement you could get a faster or slower set time. Also, since quarry dust is quite fine, you should have a denser concrete. Hig

Granite fines or rock dust is a byproduct obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust. In recent days there were also been many attempts to use Fly Ash, an industrial by product as partial replacement for cement to have higher workability, long term strength and to make the concrete more economically available.
