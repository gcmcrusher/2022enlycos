## Advanced development of fine coal desulfurization and recovery 
Abstract. Work has been carried out to develop and improve several promising methods for desulfurizing and recovering finesize coal. These methods included froth flotation, selective oil agglomeration, pelletization, and a chemical desulfurization process which involves leaching fine coal with a hot dilute solution of sodium carbonate containing dissolved oxygen or air under pressure.
