## Hydraulic Reservoir Fill Screen The SkidSteer Forum
60. The brass screen in the fill opening of the hydraulic reservoir fell off into the reservoir. My concern is it possible for the screen or pieces of the screen to get into the inlet of the hydraulic pump and cause damage to the pump. I am referring to the large line coming from the reservoir going to the pump. Thank you in advance for help.
