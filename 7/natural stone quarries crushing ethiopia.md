Kleeman crushers can withstand the daily demands of quarry operations. Jaw crushers are the best choice for primary crushing. They can handle a broad range of materials from soft to very hard rock, breaking them along natural cracks resulting in stones with flat ends. They produce the coarsest material with reduction ratios between 3:1 and 6:1.
