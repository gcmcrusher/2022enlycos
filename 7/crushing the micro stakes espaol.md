## Blackrain79's Crushing the Microstakes Book: Worth it? : poker reddit
Hi guys, I'm a relatively new player that is playing in 5NL games. I want to improve so I can build up my bankroll and move up in stakes. During my studies, I recently stumbled upon the book Crushing the Microstakes by Nate "Blackrain79" Williams. I'm wondering if anyone has read it and can provide any insight into whether this book is worth it.

Alguien quiso saber cómo había sido su evolución en el poker y Holz le hizo un breve resumen: «Estuve 2 años batallando en los micro stacks, después me fui a los mid stacks, en donde me sobrestimé y quedé por mucho tiempo break even. Tras esto pase un año y medio mejorando, hasta que logré entrar en los High Stakes, donde llevo los

## Modern Small Stakes( Crushing the microstakes 2) by BlackRain79 
I bought the book today and have almost read the whole thing. He focuses on small stakes games and how to exploit all the regs in those games.
