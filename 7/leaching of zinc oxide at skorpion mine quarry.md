## Zinc Calcine Leaching Metso Outotec
If the lead and silver content of the zinc calcine is high, the residue of neutral leaching can be leached in the Metso Outotec hot acid leaching process. The incoming zinc ferrite is leached, guaranteeing an overall high level of zinc recovery. A leaching byproduct is produced simultaneously with the highest possible lead and silver content.

The aim of this study was to extract zinc from zinc ferrite retaining iron in the new oxide matrix, to minimize the iron content in the leach liquor, and to obtain pure hematite. Hydrochloric acid was chosen because the thermodynamic data indicate much more intensive reverse dissolution of hematite in case of sulphuric acid. 2.

Mining and processing activity at Peñasquito mine. Runofmine (RoM) oxide ore is delivered onto a heap leach pile using haul trucks. It is added with lime before being placed on the pad, and leached with cyanide solution. The leached solution is then clarified, filtered and deaerated, treated with zinc dust to precipitate the precious metals.
