## Other uses of coal World Coal Association
To produce cement, energy is required. Coal is an important source of the energy needed. A hightemperature kiln, often fuelled by coal, heats the raw materials of calcium carbonate (generally in the form of limestone), silica, iron oxide and alumina to a partial melt at 1450°C, transforming them chemically and physically into a substance

## CO2 Emissions Profile of the U.S. Cement Industry US EPA
Cement production also is a key source of CO2 emissions, due in part to the significant reliance on coal and petroleum coke to fuel the kilns for clinker production. Globally, CO2 emissions from cement production were estimated at 829 MMTCO2 in 2000 7, approximately 3.4% of global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production.
