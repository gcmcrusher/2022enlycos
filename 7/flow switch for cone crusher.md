## Modelling of flow in cone crushers ScienceDirect
The Whiten crusher model, originally developed for cone crushers, has served as the basis of several approaches to model VSI crushers. In the present work, the Andersen/Awachie/Whiten model has been used as the basis for modeling a VSI crusher operating in an industrial plant in Brazil, processing quarry rock to product manufactured sand.

## 5 tips for energy efficient and productive cone crushing
This inefficient use of connected horsepower will result in a higher energy cost per ton of material crushed (kW/hr per ton). Approximately 70% of the total lube oil flow rate is being used to keep the cone crusher cool. When the actual lube oil flow rate decreases below 70%, the crusher will operate warmer than previously.

Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).
