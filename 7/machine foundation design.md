## Machine Foundations AMERICAN GEOSERVICES
A foundation provided below the superstructure of a vibrating and/or rotating machine for installation is known as machine foundation. It essentially consists of a mass of concrete. Designs of machine foundations involve consideration of static load and kinetic forces. The load of the machine is the static load which is of minor importance in

## Design Criteria of Machine Foundation Engineering Projects
A vibrating foundation fails when velocity or acceleration or displacement exceeds a certain limit at a specified frequency. Thus the design criteria are limiting values of acceleration, velocity and displacements. In addition the foundation should be safe in shear and settlements should be within permissible limits. There should be no resonance.

Some useful tips for machine foundation design. Before starting the detailing work for foundations, the following general needs concerning machine foundations should be fulfilled and the results should be verified. 1. The foundation should have contained the capacity to bear the superimposed loads devoid of producing shear or crushing failure. 2.
