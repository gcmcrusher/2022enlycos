## PFMEA: A Guide to Preventing Process Failures SafetyCulture
Process Failure Mode Effects Analysis (PFMEA), also called Process FMEA, is a qualitative tool used for the intention of preventing failures. As an aid to initiatives for process improvement, PFMEA is used by manufacturing and process engineers to identify and analyze potential failures in a process. Conducting PFMEA allows teams to prepare and

An example of a failure mode on a variable speed transfer conveyor might be a bearing seizing. A broken bearing will cause the conveyor to slow down or stop functioning. An FMEA outlines this information. For example, if a new asset is being designed, an FMEA allows you to figure out what PMs are necessary to prevent possible failure modes

## PFMEAs can Identify Special Process Characteristics Accendo Reliability
To understand how special process characteristics are identified in Process FMEAs, we have to begin with the definition of "cause" in a Process FMEA. By definition, a cause in a Process FMEAs is the potential manufacturing or assembly deficiency (or source of variation) that results in the failure mode. Think about that for a minute.

FMEA should be used at the beginning of a product's or a process's life cycle and during the entire life cycle. FMEA analysis is a continuous process that's updated from timetotime to account for all the changes that occur in the environment. You should use FMEA when: You design a process, service, or product.
