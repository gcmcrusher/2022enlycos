Currently doing fence posts and some small concrete pads around the house so I need to self mix the concrete. 1 Cement 2.5 Sand 4 Aggregate is OK for fence posts. 13bags of cement per cubic metre. The more cement the more costly of course so don't over do it. Note: These are 20kg bags of General Purpose cement.

Thus, the quantity of cement required for 1 cubic meter of concrete = 0.98/0.1345 = 7.29 bags of cement. The quantities of materials for 1 m3 of concrete production can be calculated as follows: The weight of cement required = 7.29 x 50 = 364.5 kg. Weight of fine aggregate (sand) = 1.5 x 364.5 = 546.75 kg.

For concrete, the procedure for volume is as follows: length x width x thickness. You need to divide the total cubic yards that the yield needs to determine the number of concrete bags you need. Use the following yields per each bag size: 40pound bag yields .011 cubic yards. 60pound bag yields .017 cubic yards.
