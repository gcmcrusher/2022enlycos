## Crushing Behavior and Crushing Strengths of LowDensity Foam Concrete
Understanding foam concrete crushing behavior is of special importance for its engineering applications. However, the current studies are insufficient to define key attributes that are important for material characterization and design. This study focuses on lowdensity foam concrete ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 g/cm3 (25 to 50 lb/ft3), with the

## Introduction of Waste Plastics Crushing Processes INTCO recycling
The waste plastic foam crushing process varies due to corresponding materials while different plastic foam materials have their own characteristics. 1. EPS (foam#6)/XPS. EPS and XPS belong to large lump material. Once crushed, waste EPS/XPS can be easily broken into small pieces. The basic principle of the process is to destroy the material's
