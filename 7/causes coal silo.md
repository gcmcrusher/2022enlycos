Coal silos at a coal mine. A fire outbreak in a coal silo is both dangerous and costly. In the event of combustion, several tons of smoking coal will need to be drained from the silo onto the feeder deck floor. This leads to a huge mess, an expensive clean up, and a pause in production. Additionally, the damaged equipment will need to be replaced.

What is Poor Flow? Two costly flow problems experienced in a silo, bin, or hopper are arching and ratholing. Arching (bridging) occurs when an archshaped obstruction forms above the hopper outlet and stops flow. It can be an interlocking arch, where large particles mechanically interlock to form an obstruction, or a cohesive arch.
