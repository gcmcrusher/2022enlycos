## What You Need to Know About Coolant for CNC Machining
In Conclusion. CNC coolant is alltoooften overlooked as a major component of a machining operation. The type of coolant or lubricant, and the pressure at which it's applied, is vital to both machining success and optimum shop efficiency. Coolant can be applied as compressed air, mist, in a flooding property, or as high pressure.

## 5 Reasons to Keep Machining Coolant Clean Better MRO
Dirty Coolant Hurts Machine Tool Life and Other Parts of the Machine. Cutting fluids provide lubricity and remove heat from the work zone. As coolant breaks down, the sulfur, chlorine and other extremepressure compounds contained within become ineffective. This leads to poor tool and machine life as well as problems with accuracy and part quality.
