## Extraction of Aluminium from Bauxite by Bayer's & Hall's Process Embibe
Bauxite is composed of aluminium oxide compounds (alumina), silica, iron oxides and titanium dioxide. Aluminium is obtained by the Electrolysis of Alumina. The concentration of the Bauxite ore into alumina is done by Bayer's process. Alumina is then refined into pure aluminium metal through the Hall–Héroult electrolytic process.

Aluminium was once so expensive that an aluminium bar was displayed next to the French Crown Jewels in Paris in 1855. Karl Bayer was an Austrian chemist who developed a process for extracting alumina from bauxite, and along with the HallHeroult process was able to reduce the cost of producing aluminium to drop by 80% from 1854 to 1890.
