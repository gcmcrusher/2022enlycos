The single toggle jaw crusher has fewer bearings and shafts as compared to a double toggle jaw crusher. It has more planes of movement of the swinging jaw (Hinge door movement plus vertical up and down movement) which leads to higher throughput. On the downside, it produces more fines, and has a higher jaw plate consumption. Uses one toggle plate.
