## Machining Processes: Turning, Milling, and Drilling – Trimantec
We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods. Metals, plastics, composites, and wood are all possible workpiece materials.

This limits the feed of the hob, as the hob teeth become overloaded quickly. Gashing can complete the form in one or more passes, depending on machine and setup rigidity, horsepower, and torque. Time for indexing the cutter from one tooth space to the next is reduced along with the tooth count. This works in the favor of gashing cycle time.

## Cycle Time Formula: How to Calculate Cycle Time FreshBooks
Although it is commonly confused with takt time, cycle time is simple to calculate and relatively easy to understand. In order to calculate this KPI, you'll need two critical pieces of information. The total number of goods (x) produced. The total time required to produce that number (x) of goods. With these two data points in mind, the formula is:
