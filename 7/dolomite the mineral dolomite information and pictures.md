Dolomite countertops can be quite expensive. The price of this type of countertop is around $80 to $140 per square foot. So, it is important to think about the cost before you make a decision. The stone is soft and porous which means that it is more susceptible to staining and there is a chance that water will seep into the surface of the stone

## Dolomite Mineral Uses and Properties Geology
Dolomite is a common rockforming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.
