The AF cone crusher is a compressive crusher where feed material is crushed between a fixed concave and a movable mantle. Bigger rock particles are crushed against the mantle and concave. This is called singlelayer crushing. When smaller rock particles are crushed between other rock particles, it is called multilayer crushing.

Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used.

Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so, of course, crusher performance declines. These are the two main causes of suboptimal crushing performance, but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.

The mantle is where the magic happens inside of a cone crusher. The mantle is made from steel or iron, and it's shaped similarly to a lampshade. The end of the mantle connects to the crusher's motor, and when the machine is on the mantle rotates, crushing the material in the process. It's important to note that the mantle rotates eccentrically.
