## Silica, Crystalline Overview Occupational Safety and Health 
Crystalline silica is a common mineral found in the earth's crust. Materials like sand, stone, concrete, and mortar contain crystalline silica. It is also used to make products such as glass, pottery, ceramics, bricks, and artificial stone. Respirable crystalline silica – very small particles at least 100 times smaller than ordinary sand you

Silicosis is an incurable, often fatal, disease caused by exposure to one of the most common forms of silica – crystalline silica dust. Crystalline means that the oxygen and silicon atoms are arranged in a specific pattern. The dust particles are so small you can see them only with a microscope.

Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
