## limestone Characteristics, Formation, Texture, Uses, & Facts
limestone, sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite. It may contain considerable amounts of magnesium carbonate (dolomite) as well; minor constituents also commonly present include clay, iron carbonate, feldspar, pyrite, and quartz. Most limestones have a granular texture. Their constituent grains range in size from 0.001 mm (0.

## Limestone Sand: Pros and Cons Penn State Extension
Limestone sand covering the bottom of the stream downstream from the application site. In doing so, habitat for bottomdwelling aquatic organisms is severely reduced. Loss of substrate habitat as a result of limestone sand application reportedly reduces aquatic insect numbers and completely eliminates crayfish from affected stream reaches.

## Modern Technological Applications for Limestone Mining
Rippers can be used for limestone mining as limestone is a 'rippable' sedimentary rock (refer to Sect. 3.1.1) Using rippers in small mines or for a group consisting of more than one mine is economical and productive. Instantaneous blasting or blasting with delay detonators in mines are executed in circuits.
