## What's normal:The role of temperature in bearing applications
Pumps. Depending on the application, normal bearing operating temperatures in pumps range from 100°F to 180°F, with most running between 140°F and 160°F. Although grease is used in some vertical pumps, oil is the preferred lubricant in the majority of pump applications. Standard bearing oils in pumps remain effective to approximately 180°F.

## Causes of Tire & Trunnion Wear FEECO International Inc.
In the case of tires and trunnion rollers, fugitive material can cause excess wear in the form of abrasion, gouging, and/or corrosion on loadbearing surfaces. Similarly, tramp material in the trunnion pits may also cause severe damage to components, allowing the pinch point to act as a crusher, creating aggressive abrasion between the surfaces.
