Plane grinding with diamond is the best choice to ensure flat samples from the very beginning of the preparation. Fine grinding with either MDLargo or MDAllegro will provide the best possible planeness. To avoid relief, preparation time and the type of polishing cloth used are the most important parameters.

Sample Preparation. Grinding. Before you mount your sample in a sample holder, you should consider whether you need to grind or sieve it. Grinding (or even milling) may seem an obvious requirement if you want to achieve a fine powder. For some materials, e.g. many ceramic powders, grinding presents no problems and should always be performed.
