8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

Wet ball mill is used to grind sand into mortar. It can add the water and material together. The mortar is used for producing the AAC block. Product features: 1. The ball mill is driven by rolling bearing instead of sliding bearing, which greatly reduces the friction force, makes it easier to start and significantly saves energy. 2.

The ultrafine slag slurry (UFSS) was obtained by the process of grinding the original slag in a wet ball mill, which was mixed in concrete directly. The durations of grinding were 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min which were used to replace Portland cement with different percentages, namely, 20, 35, and 50, and were designed to
