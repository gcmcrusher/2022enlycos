## What Does An Accumulator On A Crusher Do Saumur Cartes Postales
An accumulator is an energy storage device. It stores potential energy through the compression of a dry inert gas (typically nitrogen) in a container open to a relatively incompressible fluid (typically hydraulic oil). There are two types of accumulators commonly used today. The first is the bladder type (including diaphragm designs) and the

3. Protect the crusher. For example, when uncrushed objects such as iron blocks are mixed into the crushing chamber, the oil pressure in the oil pressure chamber increases to the air pressure of the accumulator, which causes the accumulator to be compressed and the oil from the oil pressure chamber Flow to the side of the accumulator.
