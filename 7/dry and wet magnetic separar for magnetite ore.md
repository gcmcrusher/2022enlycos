When finegrained magnetite is the only mineral of value and there is a minimum of dilution rock and barren material in the ore, elimination of cobbing in the crushing plant in favor of wet rougher magnetic separation in the grinding circuits should be considered. Sampling of a cobbing plant is always difficult when treating coarse material.
