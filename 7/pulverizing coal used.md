The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 330°C (650°F) from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows the usable fine coal powder out to be used as fuel. The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler.
