Results indicated that cement clinkers obey firstorder breakage kinetics in the case of both balls and cylinders. The specific rate of breakage provided by cylinders is higher than that of balls. The results also showed that − 2.00 1.70 mm is an optimum feed size for 20 mm diameter balls and 20 × 20 mm diameter cylinders.

## Degradation Kinetics of Portland Cement Pastes, Mortars and Concretes 
The degradation of samples of cement pastes, mortars and concretes in acidic solutions (pH 24) ha s b een investigated over relatively short periods, e.g. 72 hours at 25°C. The degradation rate of the cementitious material is taken as the rate of alkali leaching at constant pH; the latter is obtained directly from the amount of acid required

## Energetically modified cement Wikipedia
Energetically modified cements (EMCs) are a class of cements made from pozzolans (e.g. fly ash, volcanic ash, pozzolana), silica sand, blast furnace slag, or Portland cement (or blends of these ingredients). The term "energetically modified" arises by virtue of the mechanochemistry process applied to the raw material, more accurately classified as "high energy ball milling" (HEBM).

## Cement Chemistry The Concrete Portal
The method of grinding cement may also influence the hydration kinetics. Cements ground in high pressure roller mills set faster than in ball mills, because of higher reactivity of C 3 A and C 3 S phases, and a lowered rate of decomposition of CaSO 4.

## Flexoply Isolation Pads Kinetics NDF Kinetics Noise Control 
Kinetics Model NDF Flexoply isolation pads are recommended for noise, shock and vibration applications requiring a padtype isolator, for intermittent static unit loading of the isolation pads ranging from 50 up to 10,000 PSI (3.5 to 703 kg per sq. cm) or shock loads up to 2,000 PSI (140 kg per sq. cm). Typical INDUSTRIAL applications of Model
