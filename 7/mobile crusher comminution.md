## Hazards in mobile crushing plants – Comminution Minerallurgy
Hazards in mobile crushing plants. May 12, 2021 by Ames. Accidents in process industry occur due to various reasons, such as operation issues, human errors, inadequate process design or chemicals (Taylor 2007). One way to increase the process safety is to develop current safety management systems (Athar, Mohd Shariff et al. 2019, p. 524).

The process of comminution is the crushing and grinding of a material / ore to reduce it to smaller or finer particles. The comminution process reduces particle sizes by breaking, crushing, or grinding of ore, rock, coal, or other materials. The process is most often used in the field of mining and / or mineral processing, where mineral ore is broken down into small particles, by hammer

If impact crushing is opening a walnut with a hammer, compression crushing is the nutcracker method. A steady compression force is applied by closing the product between the mantle (or jaw) dies and the crushing chamber's wall. Compression crushers such as cones and jaw crushers normally have lower reduction ratios than HSI or VSI crushers
