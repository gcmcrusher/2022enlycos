Since the first application using an MPS mill to process pulverized coal in Germany in the mid 1960s, there have been over 2,000 different MPS mill installations operating in coalfired power plants worldwide. As one of the most popular coal pulverizers in the utility industry, the MPS mill was first introduced into the US in the early 1970s.

## Vertical Grinding Mill (Coal Pulverizer) Explained saVRee
Coal pulverizers are used to dry, grind and classify. Drying is achieved as hot gas passes through the pulverizer and removes moisture from the pulverized coal. The hot gases used should have a low oxygen content, this reduces the likelihood of accidental combustion within the mill. It is possible for hot gases to be taken directly from the

Pulverizers, also called mills, are used by many industries to grind solids to a fine powder. Performance of coal mills at power plants is critical to: Combustion efficiency/heat rate NOx & CO reduction Unit availability/power output. Optimization of the flow patterns of both air and coal entering, within, and exiting a mill is an important part of plant performance.

Coal pulverizer mills are employed to break down (pulverize) lumpy coal to fines (typically 200 mesh size) for accelerating combustion by exposing a large surface area to the action of oxygen. They may be classified into three types: contact, ball and impact mills. The failed shafts of the case under discussion were from contact type coal
