Lime mortar or torching is composed of lime and an aggregate such as sand, mixed with water. This reduces the compressive strength of the mortar but allows the wall system to function better. The lime mortar acts as a wick that helps to pull water from the brick. This can help to prevent the older brick from spalling.
