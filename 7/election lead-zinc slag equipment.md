## Flash smelting Wikipedia
Flash smelting (Finnish: Liekkisulatus, literally "flamesmelting") is a smelting process for sulfurcontaining ores including chalcopyrite.The process was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at the Harjavalta plant in 1949 for smelting copper ore. It has also been adapted for nickel and lead production.. A second flash smelting system was developed by the International Nickel

## The Utilization of Slag in Civil Infrastructure Construction
Steel slag is formed during refining operations converting crude iron into steel by combining fluxes with the nonferrous oxides and other unwanted elements in the raw materials under molten state. Slag is a nonmetallic byproduct containing dominantly CaO, SiO 2, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 and their solid solutions. Knowledge of iron and steel

## Slag Wikipedia
Slag is a byproduct of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (byproducts of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (byproduct of ferroalloy production) or nonferrous/base metals (byproducts of recovering nonferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by
