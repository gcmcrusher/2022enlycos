## Silicon dioxide Wikipedia
Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO 2, most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand.Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as a synthetic product.

Quartz is the second most common mineral in the earth's crust. Its chemical name is SiO2. Is silica harmful to the human body? There is no evidence that it is dangerous to replace it as a food additive, but further research on its role in the human body is needed. Longterm elimination of silica dust can cause lung disease. Is SiO2 a tetrahedron?

Asbestos is the common name applied to a group of silicate minerals which have a ﬁbrous crystal habit. There are six principal asbestos minerals—chrysotile, actinolite, tremolite, crocidolite (riebeckite), anthophyllite and amosite (grunerite) [1, 2]. A different chemical composition, structure and physical properties determined the use

## ShockMetamorphic Effects in Rocks and Minerals
36 Traces of Catastrophe are mineralogically selective; a given effect (e.g., isotropiza tion) will occur in grains of a single mineral (e.g., quartz or feldspar), but not in grains of other minerals, even adjacent ones. Shock metamorphism is also characterized by a pro gressive destruction of original textures with increasing shock pressure, a process that eventually leads to complete melting
