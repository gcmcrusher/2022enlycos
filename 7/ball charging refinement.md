## Weaponry: The RifleMusket and the Minié Ball HistoryNet
The Civil War's deadliest weapons were not rapidfire guns or giant cannon, but the simple riflemusket and the humble minié ball. By the time the smoke had cleared and the veterans headed back to their homes, the American Civil War had exacted a terrible human cost. In four long years of bloody fighting, half a million of the three million

## automatic refinement of ball functions
By refinement, I am sure that what is usually meant is refining the output of an algorithm. For example, I might compute sin(pi/27). Given an enclosure for pi, Arb may have a function for giving you an enclosure in which the result lies, in which case yes, you can trust that the output of that function lies in the enclosure, so long as the input lay in the enclosure you supplied (unless
