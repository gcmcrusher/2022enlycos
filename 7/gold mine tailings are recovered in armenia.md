## Ararat Gold Recovery Plant to Increase Production; Tailings Dam 
The Ararat Gold Mining Plant currently processes 1 million tons of ore a year. The new project envisages increasing productivity to 1.750 million tons due to the reconstruction of some parts of the plant. The plant's 165hectare tailings dam, 5.8 kilometers away, will also have to increase in size. Until the dump's current capacity is
