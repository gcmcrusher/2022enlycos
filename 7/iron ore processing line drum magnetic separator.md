The Reading Rare Earth Magnetic Drum (RED) uses a unique 5 pole magnetic element to generate a field intensity in excess of 0.7 Tesla on the drum skin. The magnetic element design affords the maximum field gradient and the 5 poles enables additional cleaning of the magnetic stream. This gives a very selective separation at high throughputs compared to alternative magnetic separators.
