## High Throughput Screening an overview ScienceDirect Topics
High throughput screening (HTS) is the use of automated equipment to rapidly test thousands to millions of samples for biological activity at the model organism, cellular, pathway, or molecular level. In its most common form, HTS is an experimental process in which 103 –10 6 small molecule compounds of known structure are screened in parallel.
