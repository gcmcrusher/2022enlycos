Ore reclaimed from the course ore stockpile is currently fed to two comminution lines, each consisting of a SAG mill, two parallel ball mills, and associated downstream equipment. Cyclone overflow from the circuit at a P80 of 140–180 µm reports to the rougher flotation cells. The typical ball load in the SAG mills is 15% to 18% by volume.
