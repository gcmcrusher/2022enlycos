## Coolant filtration system for carbide grinding Innovation Filter
Coolant Filtration System for Carbide Grinding. Filtering out tungsten/silicon carbide dust from grinding coolant is a very challenging process. As long as carbide remains in the coolant, it leaches cobalt and degrades the coolant. Hence, not only the coolant needs to be correctly selected but the filtration system as well.

Using no filtration at all with your tool and cutter grinding machine. The basic idea for a tool grinding machine is to use highpressure oil. The oil keeps the cutting elements like the grinding wheel and blanks cool, so they do not overheat, fail, or deform. If you do not use grinding oil, there is excessive heat generation, and the cutting
