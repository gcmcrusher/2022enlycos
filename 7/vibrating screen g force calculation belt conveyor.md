## Development and Verification of the Diagnostic Model of the Sieving Screen
The minerals processing enterprises are widely using vibrating machines to separate different fractions of materials. Sieving efficiency is greatly dependent on particle trajectories, or orbit, of periodical motion over the sieving decks. A screening process is very dependable on design parameters such as the vibrator power, synchronisation of their drives, and oscillation frequency as well as
