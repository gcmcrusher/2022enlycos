## Development and Verification of the Diagnostic Model of the Sieving Screen
The minerals processing enterprises are widely using vibrating machines to separate different fractions of materials. Sieving efficiency is greatly dependent on particle trajectories, or orbit, of periodical motion over the sieving decks. A screening process is very dependable on design parameters such as the vibrator power, synchronisation of their drives, and oscillation frequency as well as

1. The noise when the roller is seriously eccentric. When the belt conveyor is running, the rollers often produce abnormal noise and periodic vibration. Especially the return roller, due to its large length, selfweight, and high noise. There are two main reasons for noise. First, the wall thickness of the seamless steel pipe is uneven and the
