Belt Widths The belt widths are as follows: 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 84, and 96 inches. The width of the narrower belts may be governed by the size of lumps to be handled. Belts must be wide enough so that any combination of prevailing lumps and finer material does not load the lumps too close to the edge of the conveyor belt.

## How Fire Retardant Conveyor Belts Can Save You Millions
The most common cause of fire on a belt is due to the friction generated from a pulley on a stalled or slipping conveyor belt. Seized idlers and bearings also generate enough heat on the back of a moving belt to ignite fires. A second cause of fires started with conveyor belts is due to mistracking. Friction from the belt rubbing on the

Maximum operating tension (tight side tension) can now be computed by T1=Te T2 times the starting factor (1.5, 2.0, 3.0 etc.). Electric motors may have very high starting torques. CEMA recommends the use of a starting factor (multiplier) to compensate in calculations. In the quick method we equate maximum operating tension to tight side
