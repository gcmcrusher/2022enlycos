## NiobiumTantalum Ore Beneficiation – Mineral Processing
Where A in the formula stands for iron and manganese, and B stands for niobium and tantalum. The magnetization rate of niobiumiron oretantalite is (22.1 to 37.2) × 106. The dielectric coefficient of niobiumiron ore is 10 to 12, and tantalite is 7 to 8. The density of the mineral is 5.15 to 8.20 (increases with the increase of tantalum
