Sand can be used for cleaning up oil leak or any spill by dredging sand on that spill. The material will form clumps by soaking up, and we can quickly clean the mess. Sand can be used as a road base which is a protective layer underneath all roads. Industrial sand is used to make glass, as foundry sand and as abrasive sand.

## Can you use sand as a backfill? Reasons for using sand when backfilling.
Because of this, many construction benefits make use of sand as their primary backfill material. Of course, not all projects are the same. In some situations, it may be better to use a combination of material that is coarse but still strong enough to support the structure. 3. It should be stable and wellcompacted.
