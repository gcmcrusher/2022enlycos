## Bond Work Index Tests GSL Grinding Solutions Ltd
The Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BBWi) test is carried out in a standardised ball mill with a predefined media and ore charge. The Work Index calculated from the testing can be used in the design and analysis of ball mill circuits. The test requires a minimum of 10kg of sample that has been stagecrushed to 100% passing size of

See this useful summary Table of Bond Work Index by Minerals. For any circuit, whether a crushing circuit, a rod mill, or a closed ball mill circuit, the Work Index always means the equivalent amount of energy to reduce one ton of the ore from a very large size to 100 um. The sample was received crushed appropriately for the ball mill test.
