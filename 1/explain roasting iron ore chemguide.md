Extracting copper from its ores. The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite ((CuFeS_2)) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulfate ores. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of

The higher the percentage of carbon, the harder the steel becomes. Mild steel is used for lots of things nails, wire, car bodies, ship building, girders and bridges amongst others.

Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in the presence of air. It is a step in the processing of certain ores.More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas–solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth

Abstract The effect of the reduction of hematite to magnetite on the strength characteristics of iron ore materials used in blast furnaces and shaft metallization furnaces is established. The mechanism and kinetics of the process of the reduction of hematite on samples of various sizes, taking into account the effect of the temperature and composition of the gas phase on it, are studied. The

After roasting, iron concentrated ores could be recycled by magnetic separation since iron in the residues was reduced to ferriferrous oxide. Cu, In and Se ions adsorb on the surface of jarosite residues during iron precipitation, which could explain their lower residual fractions for jarosite residues. The chemical speciation of Be, Sn and

Sulfationroastingleaching basically consists of sulfating the ore sample with concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature. The existence of this phase helps to explain the difference in the nickel extraction between X and Z samples. The Z sample has around 65.8% (wt.%) of the nickel in the particle size smaller than 20 µm, or in the

Flame tests are used to identify the presence of a relatively small number of metal ions in a compound. Not all metal ions give flame colours. For Group 1 compounds, flame tests are usually by far the easiest way

The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone. Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron. The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being
