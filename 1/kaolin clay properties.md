Kaolinite is a clay mineral, with a soft consistency and earthy texture. It is easily broken and can be molded or shaped, especially when wet. Kaolinite is a lackluster and uninteresting mineral on its own, but it occasionally forms interesting pseudomorphs, especially after feldspars. It is also a common accessory to other minerals, including gem crystals in decomposing feldspar pegmatites.

Kaolin clay has very low cationexchange aptitude (approximately between 1 and 15 mEq/100g). This implies that it can only hold very minimal quantity of any class of cations at any given pH value. Therefore, it is very less reactive. However, it may transform under extreme temperatures above 500 o C. Physical Properties of Kaolin Clay
