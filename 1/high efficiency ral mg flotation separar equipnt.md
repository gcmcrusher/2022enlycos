Flotation is also one of the processes used for the recovery of recycled paper and wastewater treatment. A high froth flotation efficiency is limited to the narrow particle size range, between 50 and 600 μm for coal as shown in Fig. 4.9 [81]. The coarser the coal, the harder it is to stay attached to the air bubble.

Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is based on the separation of the solidliquid phases with the aid of small air bubbles (10–100 µm), with high values of interfacial contact area, improving the process efficiency. In the process, the air bubbles and particles or flocs form aggregates, which rise to the surface of the flotation cell to be collected.

## USA1 Use of ozone to increase the flotation efficiency of 
The use of ozone during certain stages of metal separation by flotation degrades certain collectors that are absorbed on the particle surface, as well as the collectors and frothers in the liquid slurry. As a result, the mineral particle has a fresh surface and new chemical reagent(s) can be added in the subsequent flotation step(s). Also since ozone oxidizes the iron sulfide particles faster

## Lesson 14: Sedimentation and Flotation Mountain Empire Community College
Sedimentation tanks are mostly used in water treatment. Solids that are lighter than water (oil, grease, and other floating materials) float to the top, forming scum. These floating solids are skimmed from the surface and removed. Wastewater flow leaves the sedimentation tank over an effluent weir for further treatment.

Air flotation is one of the oldest methods for the removal of solids, oil & grease and fibrous materials from wastewater. Suspended solids and oil & grease removals as high as 99% can be attained with these processes. Air flotation is simply the production of microscopic air bubbles, which enhance the natural tendency of some materials to
