Chromite ore beneficiation practices depend on the mineral characteristics of the ore deposits, gangue mineral assemblage and the degree of dissemination of constituent minerals. In general, a chromite beneficiation flow sheet has two major sections: comminution (for preparing the material to the subsequent unit operations) and concentration.
