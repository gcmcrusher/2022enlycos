Gold mining companies had an increase of 35% in revenue. Revenue for the 'other mining' segments increased by 7%. The impact of the COVID19 pandemic was evident from April 2020, with reductions in revenue being seen across the industry. South African PGMs and gold are mainly mined in deeplevel underground mines and were therefore hardest hit.
