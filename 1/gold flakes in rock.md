## Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold?
Re: Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold? ¬´ Reply #1 on: 29/07/2017 18:38:42 ¬ª. The most likely candidate for the silver and gold flakes are iron sulphides also known as iron pyrites or, "fools gold". Lead sulphide (galena) also produces silvery inclusions that would fit the bill with what you describe.

The color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow, but the greater the silver content, the whiter its color is. Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens.

Firstly, Gold possesses a yellowish streak while pyrite has a greenishblack kind of streak. The second one has to do with the hardness. Gold comes with a Mohs hardness of about 2.5 while pyrite measures about 6. Also, gold will not scratch a copper surface but copper will certainly scratch copper.

Remember that gold is much denser than the surrounding materials (up to 6 times). So, if it meets a smooth rock and slips off it, it will reach the floor much quicker than other substances. Alternatively, the rocks in your surroundings might be irregular, presenting crevices and cracks[3]. These are ideal rocks around which to look for gold.
