## Silica Sand Market Size, Share, Analysis 2022 27 Industry Demand
The glass manufacturing industry is one of the largest enduser industries of the silica sand market. Silica sand is the chief component in all types of standard and specialty glasses. It provides the essential SiO2 (silicon dioxide) component for glass formulation, and its chemical purity is the primary determinant of color, clarity, and strength.

The molten glass spreads onto the surface of the metal and produces a high quality, consistently level sheet of glass that is later cut into required sizes. This method gives the glass uniform thickness and a very flat surface. The glass manufactured thus is devoid of waves or distortion. This technique can continuously produce glass 24/7.
