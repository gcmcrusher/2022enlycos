## Making a CNC Milling Machine Ballscrew mounts THE MAKERS GUIDE
Converting a Grizzly G0704 milling machine to CNC – Part 2. A Ballscrew (sometimes spelled Ball Screw) is a type of linear actuator that translates rotary motion into linear motion. It uses ball bearing in a helical groove to transfer the motion with very little friction. The ballscrew mount attaches the ballscrew nut to the milling machine.
