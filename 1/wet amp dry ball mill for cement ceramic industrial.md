8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

Wet Ball Mill Power Draw (Bond) For wet ball mills, Bond expressed power draw as a function of the total mass of media: kW/t; The bed porosity is typically in the range of 35% to 40%. In practice, the mill shaft power for wet overflow mills calculated using the above expression appeared to overestimate the actual power when: Maximum ball size
