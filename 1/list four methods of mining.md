## A Brief Introduction to the Types of Surface Mining Methods
Openpit Mining. Openpit mining is a method in which an ore is removed by digging a pit in the ground, and is used to remove copper, gold, iron, as well as nonmetallic minerals. It is normally used when the rock layer above the ore is too weak to allow underground tunnels. In this technique, circular steps, or 'benches', are dug around

Openpit mining. Openpit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an openpit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Openpit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

4. Open cast mining. Also known as open pit mining, this is a method of surface mining where a large pit is made in the ground, and the coal is mined directly from that pit. This is a great method to use for a shallow coal seam and it is extremely productive. Of all the types of mining, this is one of the safest processes.
