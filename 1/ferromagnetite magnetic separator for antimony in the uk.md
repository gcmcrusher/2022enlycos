As antimony is typically present in industrial and commercial products only in small amounts, the concentration of antimony in waste types is low and a limited amount of antimony is currently recycled. One product relatively rich in antimony is the metal oxide varistor (MOV) used for overvoltage protection in electric circuits. To increase the antimony concentration, the MOV was pulverized

## Calibration of multilayered probes with low/high magnetic moments 
The probes consist of two decoupled magnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic interlayer, which results in four stable magnetic states: ±ferromagnetic (FM) and ±antiferromagnetic (AFM).

We prepared a recyclable magnetic MOF nanoparticle phase and used a widely available waste biomass to generate biochar to support magnetic nanoparticles applied in the treatment of aqueous antimony pollution. A mushroom waste biochar was used to support a magnetic UIO662COOH (denoted as BSMU). Adsorption of trivalent antimony (Sb (III)) onto

Magnetic measurements show that cooling triggers a ﬁrstorder magnetic transition into the ferromagnetic FM state for low concentrations of Sb x 2, Sm 5Ge 4type and a secondorder transition to FM state for 2 x 2.7 Tm 5Si 2Sb 2type . In the Gd 5Sb 0.5Ge 3.5 compound x=0.5, the ferromagnetic ordering transition occurs at 37 K, and a

A procedure for the separation and recovery of antimony from this stibnite concentrate by electrowinning was studied In the leaching experiments, a hot plate with a contact thermometer and a magnetic stirrer were used. The leaching was done in 250cc glass balloons using Teflon coated magnets. A condenser attached to the balloon prevented

Powerful electromagnets separate the ferromagnetic fraction from the nonmagnetic components, while highfrequency eddy current inducers enable separation of the para and diamagnetic fractions. Processing : The separated fractions are delivered to suitable smelters where they are reprocessed to new materials.

## Magnetic solid phase extraction for the determination of trace antimony 
To the best of our knowledge, there is still no research on speciation of antimony using magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles or their derivatives. In the present work, a novel adsorbent named octylimmobilized silicacoated magnetic Fe 3 O 4 (C8Fe 3 O 4 SiO 2 ) nanoparticles has been prepared and used for preconcentration and separation of Sb(III

A novel Ladoped magnetic biochar was synthesized by a coprecipitation method for efficient Sb(V) removal. In contrast to pristine biochar and undoped magnetic biochar, the Sb(V) adsorption capacity in Ladoped magnetic biochar was greatly improved, increasing from 2.22 mg/g and 4.85 mg/g to 18.92 mg/g at pH of 7.0, respectively.
