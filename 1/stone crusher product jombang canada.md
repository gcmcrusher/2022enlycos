Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.

## Cone Crushers McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.
