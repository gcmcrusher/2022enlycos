Flotation is one of the most used methods to upgrade natural graphite resources. However, the efficiency is usually decreased due to the entrainment of undesirable fine gangue minerals. In this work, the impact of different factors such as particle size, pulp density, and flotation reagent on the entrainment of mica and quartz in a flake graphite flotation was studied.

The flotation process involves crushing the ore to liberate separate grains of the various valuable minerals and gangue components, pulping the ore particles with water, and then selectively rendering hydrophobic the surface of the mineral of interest. A stream of air bubbles is then passed through the pulp; the bubbles attach to and levitate
