While ultrafine grinding can improve recovery and reduce downstream reagent requirements, the effect of extra particle size reduction should be balanced by the cost of additional grinding energy. For example, the Deswik TM Mill reduced a feed with d 90 of 89 µm to 20 µm with 10 kWh/t or 12 µm with 16 kWh/t. Ultimately, the economics will
