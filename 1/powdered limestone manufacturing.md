## Usage of Waste Marble Powder for the Manufacture of Limestone 
In the process of cement manufacturing, a lot of carbon dioxide (CO 2) is released into the environment, which creates a global warming problem. Limestone calcinated clay cement (LCCC) can be used to partially solve this problem. In the present paper, the use of waste marble powder to manufacture calcinated limestone clay cement has been discussed.
