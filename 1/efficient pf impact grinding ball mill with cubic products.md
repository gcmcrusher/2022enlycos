## Dry Grinding and Wet Grinding of Ball Mill China Crusher Mesto 
Dry grinding of the ball mill requires that the material in the mill is dry, and no water or other liquids can be added. The material is ground by the medium of the ball mill in the mill, and the products that meet the requirements are carried out by the wind or airflow. The main equipment of the wet grinding of the ball mill is a wet ball mill.

1.Speed of rotation. The rotation speed is an important parameter that directly affects the grinding efficiency of the ball mill. When the rotation rate is too low, the impact on the material will be small, which will lead to substandard fineness, thus affecting the grinding efficiency; when the rotation rate is too high, the impact energy of the steel ball will increase, but the cycle The

The speed of ball mill directly affects the motion state of steel balls and ores in the ball mill. When the speed is too slow, the steel balls and ore will slide down without rising high, and the crushing effect will be small; when the speed is too fast, the grinding medium will attach to the inner wall of the ball mill and rotate. The ore and
