Calcareous sands are widespread in coastal areas. Particle breakage, which is regarded as one of the most typical characteristics of calcareous sand [16, 45, 54], often leads to poor engineering properties, which poses a challenge to coastal infrastructure construction [].As the strength and stress–strain behaviour of calcareous sand are greatly affected by crushing or particle breakage

Occurrence of crushing was evaluated by comparison of grain size distributions before and after the densification. Instead of having to divide the whole 3.5 kg of sand into manageable portions to sieve, it was originally assumed that crushing would occur mostly in the top layer; hence a 120 g sample was taken from there.

## A first survey of grinding with highcompression roller mills
The size reduction occurs by interparticle crushing. The characteristic wear measure of a roller mill is given by the thickness dw of the layer worn off per revolution, which depends o the liner material, the feed material, the compression and the cir cumferential speed u. The wear rate rh follows from: rh= 2pldwLu ( 3 ) with the density

GP cone crusher is a compressive crusher where feed material is crushed between a fixed concave and a movable mantle. Bigger rock particles are crushed against the mantle and concave. This is called singlelayer crushing. Smaller rock particles are crushed between other rock particles, which is called multilayer crushing.

## Investigation of interparticle breakage as applied to cone crushing
Increasing the degree of interparticle crushing is claimed to improve crushing efficiency and product shape. The current study uses form conditioned crushing tests (geometry controlled compression) to investigate how multiple particles respond to crushing loads. By variation of test parameters the breakage characteristics of a rock material can
