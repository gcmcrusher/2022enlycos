In fact, the use of bauxite is somewhat limited to aluminium production. Hence, the main use of bauxite in Jamaica is to convert it to alumina for exportation. However, let's not detract its importance, as aluminium plays a vital role in creating a number of items. However, in 2017, the bauxite mining and aluminium processing plant was
