A population balance model can incorporate each of these key factors. The power of the model not only helps to predict gravity gold recovery but can also assist in trouble shooting existing circuits. The GRG Test (Ore Characterization) The gravityrecoverablegold content of an ore, as obtained via a GRG test, provides a quantitative theoretical limit of gold that can be recovered using a BCC.

In order to completely distill the mercury from the amalgam, maintain a temperature of at least 400°C. The temperature should then be raised a few hundred degrees for the remaining 30 minutes to ensure all mercury is distilled and removed from the amalgam. Distill the mercury for around 56hours, the gold recovery rate can reach 99%.

## Gravity Recovery of Gold From Within Grinding Circuits
The long residence time of the gold within the grinding circuit can cause some of the GRG to become nongravity recoverable due to smearing on to grinding media, mill liners and gangue minerals. This effect is minor as more than 98% of the GRG entering the ball mill remains gravity recoverable after grinding (LaPlante, 2000).

Important amalgams Zinc amalgam. Zinc amalgam finds use in organic synthesis (e.g., for the Clemmensen reduction). It is the reducing agent in the Jones reductor, used in analytical chemistry.Formerly the zinc plates of dry batteries were amalgamated with a small amount of mercury to prevent deterioration in storage. It is a binary solution (liquidsolid) of mercury and zinc.

I frequently investigate gold mines from the 1800's. One style of mining is known as "Quartz Mining." The gold (usually small amounts) is contained in quartz veins and the quartz is underground. Because of this, these mines have tunnels to get to the quartz and some sort of equipment to break the quartz to a powder so the gold can be removed.

## Mill leaching: a viable substitute for mercury amalgamation in the 
The amount of gold recovered by amalgamation of concentrates is not always higher than when the whole ore is amalgamated since recovery is governed by gold grain liberation, i.e. by the efficiency of the grinding process. However, Hg loss is substantially higher when amalgamation is conducted in ball mills.

## Gold Amalgamation Equipment Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Wherever free gold occurs in a heavy concentrate, whether from placer or milling operations, the Amalgamation Drum is the ideal machine to remove the gold in the form of amalgam, leaving a mineralfree tailing. Ordinarily a single large ball is used and this grinds and amalgamates the mineral with the least possibility of flouring the mercury.
