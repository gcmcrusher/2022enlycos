The impact force occurs as the material enters the crusher and is impacted by the rotating roll. Shear and compression forces occur as the feed material is pulled between the crushing plate and/or crushing rolls. Depending on the feed size, material is fed into the crushing chamber and encounters a single or a pair of rotating rolls.
