## The Solutions Beyond Coal Sierra Club
The Fight Against Dirty Fuel. We've been fighting the use of coal to fuel power plants for a long time now and have already closed more than 300 coal plants in the United States. We've also avoided over 8000MW of proposed gas plants, which would have emitted the equivalent of 30 million cars in a year. See our victories.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, lowcarbon peat, to coal, an energy and carbondense black or brownishblack sedimentary rock.
