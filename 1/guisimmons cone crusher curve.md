## Analysis and optimization of cone crusher performance
The operational part of the cone crusher is the crushing chamber, which consists of a mantle and a concave liner. As shown in Fig. 1, the axis of the mantle intersects the axis of the crushing chamber at point O, which is the pivot point.The angle between the two axes is γ, which is the eccentric angle.During operation of the crusher, the mantle moves around the axis of the crushing chamber.
