In 1991 the Canadians developed the SAGPower Index (SPI), test using 2 kg of material in a 300 mm diameter mill. This test has been further developed by Starkey, Hindstrom anudes a Bond Ball mill work

## Bond Impact Crushing Work Index Procedure and Table of Crushability
The test determines the Bond Impact Work Index which is used with Bond's Third Theory of Comminution to calculate net power requirements when sizing crushers. It is also used to determine the required openside settings (jaw crushers and gyratory crushers) or closedside settings (cone crushers) for a given product size.P80 = 25400 x Oss x (0.04Wi 0.40)

The Bond crushing work index test procedure is not terribly well described, and different laboratories have different procedures that can result in different results (by up to 50% 100%). Dr Cameron Brigg's 1997 PhD thesis from the JKMRC "A Fundamental Model of a Cone Crusher" is particularly enlightening on this subject. He measured
