In the modern coal mining plant, we often use steel cord rubber belt conveyor to move coal in underground. Underground coal mining is one of the oldest forms of mining. This type of underground mining took a lot of planning, where tunnels were built to and from ventilation shafts and rail shafts to allow for transporting coal with belt conveyor.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
