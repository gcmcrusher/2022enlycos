## Gold recovery by electrowinning & reducing copper content 
Gold recovery by electrowinning & reducing copper content (10 replies and 6 comments) A. and then with other hot cyanide desorption for gold recovery, with this method you can extract more than 60 % of copper. Sulfuric acid leaching is certainly not safe and expensive process, but it's the gold, all his expensive extraction technology.
