## Worlds largest flotation cells improve copper and molybdenum recovery 
The TankCell e630 flotation cell has a nominal volume of 630 m 3, and is equipped with a FloatForce mechanism with a diameter of 2200 mm. The mechanical design of TankCell e630 is a direct scaleup from TankCell e300 and TankCell e500. For testing purposes these flotation cells were equipped with an auxiliary impeller, called FlowBooster™.

Determine the order of the flotation kinetics and hence calculate the rate constant. 18.5. A nickel flotation bank of 12 cells is surveyed and the flotation recovery and residence time in each cell is given as follows. 1. Calculate the flotation rate constant of the nickel mineral in the individual cells 1, 6 and 12.

Plant Flotation Machines in Banks. In the mechanical flotation cells the feed can be introduced directly to the impeller zone from the side as in a Denverstyle Sub A subaeration machine. A centrally located paddlewheel type impeller generates a rotating pulp vortex which extends between two stationary elements: the sandpipe located at the
