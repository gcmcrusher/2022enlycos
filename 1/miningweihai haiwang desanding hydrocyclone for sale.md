Water, mixed with oil, is fed tangentially into the hydrocyclone. The oily water starts to spin within the hydrocyclone. The mixture accelerates as it flows through the unit sending the lighter oil to the center for removal through the overflow. Cleaned water reports to the underflow. Typical applications include: Hydrocyclone with Grit Pot
