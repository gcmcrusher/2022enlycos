## Iron Ore Mining Techniques Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

By. Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithiumcontaining salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithiumcontaining rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.
