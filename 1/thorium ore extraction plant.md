when thorium232 absorbs a neutron, it transmutes to uranium238, a viable nuclear fuel. Originally, thorium extraction was a process that was high in energy and waste, using large amounts of heat and solvent. Modern science is working to produce thorium more efficiently. In this paper, several common thorium extraction processes are discussed.

The principal thorium ore is monazite, a mixture of rareearth and thorium phosphates containing up to 30% ThO 2. Monazite sands are widely distributed throughout the world. In Canada thorium is recovered from uranothorite (a mixed thoriumuranium silicate accompanied by pitchblende) as a coproduct of uranium.

The benefit of a thorium reactor is that just one ton of this element can produce as much energy as an estimated 200 tons of uranium. Yet, when thorium is compared to coalfired power plants, the difference is much greater. One ton of thorium can create the same amount of energy as 3.5 million tons of coal.
