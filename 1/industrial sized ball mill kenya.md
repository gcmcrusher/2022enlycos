## Investigation of flow dynamics of porous clinkers in a ball mill using 
A radiotracer investigation was carried out in a ball mill of a cement plant in Kenya. Residence time distribution (RTD) of raw feed to the mill was measured using Technetium99m adsorbed on the clinkers as a radiotracer. From the measured RTDs, solid holdup and mean residence times (MRTs) in the ball mill and associated separator were determined.
