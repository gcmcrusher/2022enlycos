1.. IntroductionThe setting behaviour of cement is mainly due to the reaction of tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A), 3CaO · Al 2 O 3.The reaction of pure C 3 A with water leads to immediate stiffening of the paste, known as flash set. Thus, gypsum is added to the cement clinker during the grinding of Portland cement to retard the rapid reaction between C 3 A and water (Neville, 2002).

Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomite. Gypsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4). The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.
