## Step by Step Guide to the Wet Grinding Process: Everything You Need to Know
Step 1: Wetting. The first step to wet grinding is eliminating air from the surface of the raw feed, so that each individual particle is fully in contact with the liquid slurry. Ensuring complete contact is vital for effective milling. This requires a liquid with lower surface tension than the free surface energy of the solid.

## Rubber Asphalt Cost & Analysis Asphalt Plus
Rubberized Asphalt Benefits. • ECR reduces the cost of a two grade bump: by $2$4 per mix ton. • ECR makes your plant run faster compared to polymer modified mixes: lower mix viscosities permit 1015% faster plant throughput. • ECR generates less waste: mixes leave the truck with almost no residue in the bed, reducing truck cleanout waste.
