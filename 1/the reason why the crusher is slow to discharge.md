First, you need to remove the capacitor from the generator and then discharge it with the help of a screwdriver that has an insulated handle. After it is discharged, the next step is to note the reading on it which must be /5uF of the rating that is mentioned on it. Anything more or less will indicate that the capacitor needs to be repaired

## Faster or slower to crush cans? Physics Forums
A) Spin the tires faster, The momentum of the heavy rubber tire will effectively crush the cans "flatter". B) Spin the tire slower, giving the air pressure in the tires more time to flatten the cans. The tires are in constant contact with each other, and I normally run 20Psi of air in each tire.
