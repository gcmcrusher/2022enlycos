## Contraplex CW II Hosokawa Alpine
The Contraplex is a fine impact mill with two driven pin discs. In counterrotating mode, much higher relative speeds are possible than with the UPZ fine impact mill with only one driven pin disc. The highest relative speed develops at the outermost pin rows and can be up to 240 m/s. The fineness can be adjusted by altering the pin disc speeds.
