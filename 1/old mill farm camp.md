## Old Mill State Park Minnesota DNR
Beginning in 1886, a series of mills were built in and around the park. The mills were damaged and rebuilt several times during the late 1800s. These mills were once powered by water, wind, and even a Case steam engine No. A359. In 1897, two mills were moved to where the "old mill" now stands in the park. The mills were sold to the state in 1937.
