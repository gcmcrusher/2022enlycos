A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

The Bernoulli principle therefore explains the main reasons for fluid flow that physicists need to consider in fluid dynamics. Either the fluid flows as a result of elevation (so its potential energy changes) or it flows because of pressure differences in different parts of the fluid (so fluids in the highenergy, higherpressure zone move to the lowpressure zone).

Bernoulli's Effect – Spinning ball in an airflow. Bernoulli's effect has another interesting consequence. Suppose a ball is spinning as it travels through the air. As the ball spins, the surface friction of the ball with the surrounding air drags a thin layer (referred to as the boundary layer) of air with it.It can be seen from the picture the boundary layer is on one side traveling in

Horizontal and vertical pressing is basically when the team (or a section of the team) moves collectively towards the ball in a purely horizontal or vertical fashion – which is more theoretical. When looking at the concept of backwards pressing, it is referring to when a player presses the ball once it has already past his position on the field.
