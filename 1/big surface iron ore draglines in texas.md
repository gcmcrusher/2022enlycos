Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semihard cokingcoal, semisoft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

Really the only time you see lever drags for iron on the surface is throwing bombs and raiders (ie heavy wahoo lures) in big fish country. Then a little extra drag and maybe 2 speeds is very useful. For true "surface iron" (ie Tady 45, Salas 7x) they simply don't cast the lighter, less dense lures very well as compared to a star drag reel.

In general, bog ores consist primarily of iron oxyhydroxides, commonly goethite (FeO(OH)). Ironbearing groundwater typically emerges as a spring. The iron is oxidized to ferric hydroxide upon encountering the oxidizing environment of the surface. Bog ore often combines goethite, magnetite and vugs or stained quartz.
