In the design process of the belt conveyor, when the width B is equal to or less than 800mm, the idler diameter should be ø89mm. When the width is 1000 1400mm, then the roller diameter should be ø108mm. In order to enhance productivity, trough idlers are usually used as upper idlers to support the conveyor belt to transport bulk material.

## Trough Conveyors
Trough conveyors are commonly used on transfer lines, small parts handling, and food processing. They share most of the design characteristics of twoaxle conveyors but with the additional raised edges to contain the product on the belt. This feature requires belts to be flexible and to maintain their shape over the pulleys and on the return.

Dragchain conveyors can likewise prove troublesome for pellets because they, too, can grind them up, though the mechanism is different. A conveyor's design drastically influences this tendency, however. It isn't a universal flaw, though it does accompany the most common chain conveyor design: a single chain that runs freely down the trough.

As a general rule, trough loading of 45percent can be used for light, freeflowing and nonabrasive bulk materials. Trough loadings of 15 and 30percent are typically used for denser, sluggish and more abrasive bulk materials. The inlet of a screw conveyor is always control fed by another device such as: Screw Conveyor; Screw Feeder; Belt Conveyor

A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward.

The good, better and best of screw conveyors for feed and grain. Feed and Grain is one of the oldest, and most well documented applications for screw conveyors. It is estimated that up to 60% of the total screw conveyor market is in feed and grain and with the explosion in new feed mill builds over the last ten years, this number is growing.

Trough feeders are also often used to spread out materials in a uniform layer. Special Feeders Special spiral elevating conveyors lift materials vertically up to 20 ft within a very small horizontal area. All vibrating feeder/conveyors are well suited to batching applications due to their characteristic quick cutoff of material flow.
