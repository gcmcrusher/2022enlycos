Mixing of raw materials: The processes used for the manufacture of portland cement can be classified as dry and wet. In dry process. The raw materials are first reduced in size of about 25mm in crushers and Crushed material is ground to get fine particles into ball mill or tube mill. Each material after screening is stored in a separate hopper.
