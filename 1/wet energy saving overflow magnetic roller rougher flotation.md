If the disseminated particle size of copper mineral is relatively small, consider to adopt stage grinding and separation process.

## Mineralogical and surface chemical characterization of flotation feed 
Wet grinding is more energyefficient than dry grinding in terms of grinding time. • Wear of the mill and the grinding media is higher with wet grinding. • Decreased flotation efficiency of the sulphide ore was observed after dry grinding. • Decrease is suggested to be due to surface hydroxylation and increased Py activation. •
