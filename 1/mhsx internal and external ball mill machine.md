Automatic external threads are not available for milling at this time. It is possible to machine approximate external threads using ball and flat end mills if threads are modeled and are at least ½13 (M12) or larger. Threaded holes on turned parts are also available and external threads are offered on the axial diameters.

It will become a standard gear calculation if x1 = x2 = 0. If the center distance, ax, is given, x1 and x2 would be obtained from the inverse calculation from item 4 to item 8 of Table 51. These inverse formulas are in Table 52. Pinion cutters are often used in cutting internal gears and external gears.
