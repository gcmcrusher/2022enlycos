## Ball Milling an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force, as opposed to the Scotch Tape or sonication that mainly use normal force. Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.

For many graphite and graphene applications, mainly for those needing high electrical conductivity, the presence of ordered graphitic structure with functional groups being confined to the graphitic edges, is often preferred [1,2,3,4,5,6].Graphite functionalization by ballmilling of graphite with gases (CO 2, N 2, F 2 and Cl 2), liquids (SO 3, Br 2) and solids (I 2, maleic anhydride and

An improved method for mass production of goodquality graphene nanosheets (GNs) via ball milling pristine graphite with dry ice is presented. We also report the enhanced performance of these GNs as working electrode in lithiumion batteries (LIBs). In this improved method, the decrease of necessary ball milling time from 48 to 24 h and the increase of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area

A simple and effective xylitolassisted mechanochemical stripping method has been used to peel graphite into graphene nanosheets (GNSs). Using xylitol as a ball milling aid can increase the shear force in the ball milling process and well get over the Van der Waals interlayer force between adjacent graphite layers. The prepared graphene has large horizontal size, thin thickness and high output
