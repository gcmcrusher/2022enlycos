## gold processing Mining and concentrating Britannica
When gold dissolution is complete, the goldbearing solution is separated from the solids. With ores of higher gold content ( i.e., greater than 20 grams of gold per ton of ore), cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching, which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent for several hours in large tanks equipped with agitators.

The comminution product must be 8090% passing 75 µm. Normally, the processes is employed when the gold content is ranging from 5 to 15 g/t. The grinding circuit is the first cyanidation circuit and the ball mill works as leaching drums. Once liberation is complete, the next step is to agitate the slurry to perform a complete dissolution of gold.
