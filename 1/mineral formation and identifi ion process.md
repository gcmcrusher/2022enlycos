Minerals form in all geologic environments and thus under a wide range of chemical and physical conditions, such as varying temperature and pressure. The four main categories of mineral formation are: (1) igneous, or magmatic, in which minerals crystallize from a melt, (2) sedimentary, in which minerals are the result of sedimentation, a process whose raw materials are particles from other

4 Crystals and Crystallization. KEY CONCEPTS. With just a few exceptions, all minerals are crystalline. Crystalline substances have an orderly and repetitive atomic arrangement. Crystals grow from small seeds and sometimes become very large. Igneous minerals precipitate from a magma; most of them are silicates.

## Mineral Formation Earth Science Socratic
Explanation: The general way minerals are formed is through the process of crystallization. There are many different example of this, including through the crystallization of magma or the crystallization of lava. The crystallization of magma cools inside the crust, while the crystallization of lava cools and then hardens on the surface.
