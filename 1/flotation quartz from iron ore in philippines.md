## Flotation Machine_Zoneding Machine
Flotation machine applies to separation of nonferrous metal, ferrous metal, noble metal, nonmetallic mine, chemical material. And flotation machine can be used in roughing, scavenging, selection or reverse flotation.During the flotation process, pulp will be mixed with drug firstly and agitated. Then target ore grains will selectively attach
