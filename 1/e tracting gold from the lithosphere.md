Three methods are used to obtain gold from the lithosphere: panning, open cast mining and shaft mining.n n ; Gold ore must be processed so that the metal can be removed. One way to process the ore after it has been crushed is a method called gold cyanidation. A cyanide solution is added to the crushed ore so that a goldcyanide solution is

Large tunnels started to be cut into the Earth to access minerals buried deep underground. New processing methods meant new kinds of metals could be mined. The main stages in mining are: exploration, extraction, refining, manufacturing and marketing. We will take a brief look at exploration, extraction and refining.

One of the first metals to be discovered was gold, probably because of its beautiful shiny appearance. Gold was used mostly to make jewelery because it was too soft to make harder tools. Later, copper became an important metal because it could be hammered into shape, and it also lasted a lot longer than the stone that had previously been used

Many pyrite and pyrrhotite minerals contain gold, which is often recovered when extracting copper from lode vein deposits. The purity of gold is stated in terms of fineness and carats (ct). Fineness is defined as the parts per 1000. For example gold with a fineness of 800 means it is 80% pure gold. Alternatively, gold that is 100% pure is 24ct.

The figure below shows how these different types of rock are formed in the lithosphere. Many of the elements that are of interest to us (e.g. gold, iron, copper), are unevenly distributed in the lithosphere. In places where these elements are abundant, it is profitable to extract them (e.g. through mining) for economic purposes.
