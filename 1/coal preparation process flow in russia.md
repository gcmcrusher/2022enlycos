Coal sampling is the first step before ordering the bulk coal material and generating power by coal. As we know, the purpose of coal sampling and preparation is to get a precision sample which can represent the entire lot. The coal sampling procedure seems like a simple procedure, but it has many rules in the sampling industry.

Modern Coal Preparation Advantages. Flotation, with the "SubA" gravity flow principle, provides the ideal way to treat coal fines even as coarse as —3/16" top size. According to reports from plants operating for the production of metallurgi­cal coke, each percent ash in the coal carries a penalty of 2$ per ton of coal.
