## Effect of chemical additives on the dynamics of grinding media in wet 
Recent papers on the role of grinding aids in wet ball mills indicate that certain polymeric aids favorably act by altering pulp rheology, leading to improved production rates at high pulp densities. From an analysis of the force field acting on a ball inside the mill, this critical viscosity can be estimated and the results are in

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particlesize measurement device and sizecontrol cyclones.
