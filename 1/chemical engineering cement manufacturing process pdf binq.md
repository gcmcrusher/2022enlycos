Alberto Mian, François Maréchal, in Computer Aided Chemical Engineering, 2013. 1 Introduction. Cement production is a thermal energy intensive process, which requires heating solid particles up to 1450°C and cooling it down. The process generates hot and CO 2 rich exhaust streams. Fin order to study energy efficiency of the process, authors like Mujumdar et al. (2006, 2007) developed

The cement industry is likely to play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat anthropogenic climate change. Many decarbonization pathways suggest that direct specific emission levels of around 350 – 410 kg CO 2 /t cement will be required. However, increasing clinker substitution, alternative fuel use, and thermal energy efficiency can only lead to specific emissions per tonne
