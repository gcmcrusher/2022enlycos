## HighTemperature Reaction Mechanism of Molybdenum Metal in Direct Coal 
In this paper, the extraction residue of direct coal liquefaction residueDCLR(ER) was used as raw material. The hightemperature reaction mechanism of Mo compound in DCLR(ER) was investigated using a synchronous thermal analyzer and the Factsage database. The high temperature reaction of DCLR(ER)MoO3 in an oxygen atmosphere consists of pyrolysis of organic components at 400–600 °C

## Energy and the environment explained Recycling and energy
Recycling is the process of collecting and processing materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash and turning them into new products. Recycling often saves energy and natural resources. Natural resources include land, plants, minerals, and water. When we use materials more than once, we conserve natural resources.

Coal is a rich source of energy formed from plants that grew in swamps tens to hundreds of millions of years ago. The plants were buried deeply under younger and younger layers of dirt and rock, heated, and compressed into a carbonrich rock. [1] Burning coal releases more carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced than any other fossil fuel.
