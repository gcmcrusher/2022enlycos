## Ball Mill Liners Material Selection And Application
Force analysis. The main function of the ball mill liner is to protect the mill and use the convex peak of the liner to play the ball to grind and crush the material. Therefore, the main failure mode of the liner is abrasive wear under the repeated impact of small energy. Fig. 1 shows the motion diagram of grinding ball and material.

After each cycle, the mill was stopped and the wear (weight and diameter) was measured for every ball type. Before the milling process, 143 type I balls, 316 type II balls, and 498 type III balls were introduced into the mill. After every stop, the ball wear for each of the 143 type I balls was measured and the arithmetic mean was calculated.
