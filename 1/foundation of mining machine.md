## Spotlight on foundation failure in rock slopes Canadian Mining Journal
The mining of the weak zone resulted in acceleration of slope movement. This ended in a tilted, failed rock mass which slumped towards the weathered biotite zone and truncated at the fault like a broken cantilever. These observations suggested that the failure was likely caused by settlement within the weathered biotite zone.

Deep foundation support systems are constructed to transfer structural loads through soils of inadequate strength to stronger soils or rock at greater depths below the surface. Foundation support systems are designed and constructed with consideration of axial and lateral load support, uplift force resistance, and settlement control.

Foundations of Data Mining. Machine learning is the science of making computers act without being explicitly programmed. Instead, algorithms are used to find patterns in data. It is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it, for instance in web search, speech recognition, and (soon) selfdriving cars.
