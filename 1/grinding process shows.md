Applications of Abrasive Grinding Wheels Abrasive cutting, also known as grinding, is the process of removing steel from small chips with irregularly formed abrasive particles. These fragments can also be found as a groundsheet, bonded spokes, and polished belts. Small abrasive grains are tied together by a binding film in grinding wheels.
