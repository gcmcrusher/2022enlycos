The max feeding size is 400mm. 50% size is 100mm,25% size is 150mm & 25% size is 400mm. 3. The capacity is 30tph. 4. Zinc grade: 68%, lead grade: 1113%. Grinding to 02mm can have a good recovery rate of zinc and lead. According to his mining information, our engineers made a flowchart suitable for him.

## CopperLeadZinc ores Danafloat
The zinc reporting to the bulk flotation tails feeds the zinc circuit which is operated as previously described in the leadzinc flotation section. Which flotation scheme used in the differential copperlead bulk concentrate separation is generally and often dependent upon which mineral has the greater mass in the bulk concentrate.

## Efficient flotation recovery of lead and zinc from refractory leadzinc 
At the Huili leadzinc dressing plant, flotation of leadzinc sulfide ore was divided in two parallel series, each of which had the process capacity of 522 tons/day. After the flotation of sulfide leadzinc minerals, the tailings of the two series merged together into hydrocyclones for desliming, and then the underflow of the hydro

Of the plants that produced secondary lead at year end 2013, 12 had capacities of 30,000 tons per year of refined lead or greater and accounted for more than 95% of secondary production. The main constituent minerals of lead sulphide ore are galena and sphalerite, all of which are primary ore. Galena has good floatability. In most leadzinc
