## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Raw material preparation – During the process for pelletization iron ore concentrate from iron ore beneficiation plant is dried and heated to around 120 deg C. The dried material is fed to the ball mill for grinding. Concentrate/ground iron ore of typical size 80 % less than 45 microns (0.045 mm) with a moisture content of around 9 % is
