## Wolframite Archives Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The present great demand for tungsten due to world conditions has resulted in an increase of tungsten ore dressing problems for our metallurgists. The flowsheet study shown here was recently developed for treatment of a very complex tungstengold ore. The flowsheet study previously shown for tungsten was devised for a simple tungsten ore free

This is found in tungsten trioxide. In order to extract the useful minerals from the rock, crushing machines break down the ore into much smaller chunks. After this is accomplished, those chunks are then sent to an oredressing plant. Eventually and depending on the destination of the ore, what comes out, will become your new piece of jewelry.
