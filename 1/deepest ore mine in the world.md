Miners produced roughly three billion tonnes of iron ore in 2019, representing close to 94% of all mined metals. The primary use of all this iron is to make steel. In fact, 98% of iron ore goes into steelmaking, with the rest fulfilling various other applications. Industrial and technology metals made up the other 6% of all mined metals in 2019.

The mine owes its success to economies of scale. The ore is low grade, producing about 10.6 pounds of copper per ton of ore, but a massive amount of it is mined. Furthermore, for every ton of ore, about two tons of overburden must be removed. Mining in Bingham Canyon began in the late 1880s with small underground mines that targeted highgrade ore.
