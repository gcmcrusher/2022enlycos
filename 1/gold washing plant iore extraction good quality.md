## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining Earthworks
Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.

## Environmental Impacts of Gold Mining Earthworks
Gold mining is one of the most destructive industries in the world. It can displace communities, contaminate drinking water, hurt workers, and destroy pristine environments. It pollutes water and land with mercury and cyanide, endangering the health of people and ecosystems. Producing gold for one wedding ring alone generates 20 tons of waste.

The gold was analysed by means of a PerkinElmer 200 atomic absorption device after extraction of gold with the solvent diisobutyl ketone, and the mercury was analysed with a UV device. Also, for the determination of free cyanide in solution, titration was employed with standard silver nitrate (0.01 M) and potassium iodide (10%) as indicator.
