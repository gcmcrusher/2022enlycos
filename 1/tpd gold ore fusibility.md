Specific Heat of Gold. The specific heat of gold is 0.0324 (Regnault) or 0.0316 (Violle). What is the Fusibility of Gold. Gold fuses, after passing through a pasty stage, at a clear cherryred heat, just below the fusing point of copper and much above that of silver. The metal expands considerably on fusing, and contracts again on solidifying.
