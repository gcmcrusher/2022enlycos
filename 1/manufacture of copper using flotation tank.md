Preferential flotation of copper ore. This process can be used when the copper content of the ore is much higher than that of nickel. Pump the ore pulp into the agitation tank, add the sulfide inhibitor and copper collector, send the mixture into the flotation machine to get copper concentrate and nickelbearing tailings.

The Old Copper Complex in North America has been radiometrically dated to 9500 BP—i.e., about 7480 BCE—making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world. The earliest evidence of coldhammering of native copper comes from the excavation at Çayönü Tepesi in eastern Anatolia, which dates between 7200 to 6600 BCE.

The conditioned mineral slurry is then processed in flotation cells, which are essentially agitated tanks into which finelydispersed air bubbles are introduced. The desired hydrophobic mineral will then attach to the air bubbles and float to the top of the flotation cell, where it will be skimmed off as a mineralladen froth.

## DISSOLVED AIR FLOTATION – FlotLife
Wastewater is pumped into a flotation tank or basin and hit with dissolved air causing microscopic bubbles adhere to suspended solids causing them lift to the surface of the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device and drained toward a sludge discharge tank. Notfloating solids sink to the bottom of the DAF tank from where they

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 9799%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
