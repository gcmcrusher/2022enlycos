In the wet processing of kaolin clay, the clay crude is initially deflocculated (dispersed) with a synthetic watersoluble salt having an organic polymeric anion. The deflocculated clay then undergoes further processing, including fractionation, floccing with an agent which must include alum, bleaching, filtration, rinsing and redeflocculation.

Two main methods have been used for the refining of the natural clay, which are the air flotation method or dry process method, and the wet process method. In the dry process, the clay is dried, pulverized, and then carried by currents of hot air into classifying chambers, from which it emerges as a stream of finely powdered kaolin.
