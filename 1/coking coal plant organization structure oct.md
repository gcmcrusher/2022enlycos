For instance, fines account for around 20 wt% of the raw coal feed in a typical hard coking coal processing plant in Australia (Mackinnon and Swanson, 2010) and up to 40 wt% of raw coal feed on a worldwide basis (Aplan and Arnold, 1991). Despite its importance, the control of froth flotation is poor, largely owing to lack of tools to measure

Coking coal, or metallurgical coal, has been produced in the United States for nearly 200 years. Coking coal is primarily used in the production of coke for use in the steel industry, and for other uses (for example, foundries, blacksmithing, heating buildings, and brewing). Currently, U.S. coking coal is produced in Alabama, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.
