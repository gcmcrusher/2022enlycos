## Coal Fired Power Plant Case Study: Coal Crusher Gearbox Lube Filtration 
The Problem Coal fired power plants typically operate several ball mills or coal pulverizing mills to crush the incoming coal to the optimum size for combustion. This means that each power generation unit has five or six mills. The gearboxes that run these coal mills are usually lubricated with high viscosity oil, such as ISO VG320 or ISO VG460.

## A comparison of the results obtained from grinding in a stirred media 
Lignite coal samples, containing pyritic sulphur, were taken from Nallihan/Ankara, Turkey. The coal samples were crushed to −3350 μm size by the combination of a jaw crusher and a cone crusher, respectively, and then screened into mono size groups (−3350 2360 μm, −2360 1700 μm, −1700 1180 μm) by Russell sieve.Analytical properties of lignite coal were determined and are
