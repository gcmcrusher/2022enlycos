## Cement mill Wikipedia
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

Crushing, sizing, milling, breaking technology for every application. Raw materials are so diverse. Even within a single mine or quarry you could be dealing with an extreme range: hard to soft, dry to sticky. Your crushing and sizing solutions need to be able to cope with whatever you throw at them – reliably, and in good time.
