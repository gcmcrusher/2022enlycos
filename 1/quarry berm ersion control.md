Erosion Control – Berms and Blankets. Berms and mulch blankets can be installed specifically for your site. Berms are composed of Lane Garden Compost and can be blown in place at a cost lower than the installation and removal of silt fencing. Mulch blankets are used over flat areas at a depth of 1/2″ to 2″ using Lane Garden Compost.
