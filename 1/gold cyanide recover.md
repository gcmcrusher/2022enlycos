The use of cyanide in gold recovery has been a controversial topic in the face of social and environmental concerns, especially after spillage accidents as seen in Baia Mare in 2000. This event not only triggered stricter regulations around the use of cyanide in mining, some countries eventually passed federal laws that banned gold cyanidation.

How is cyanide used in mining? A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.
