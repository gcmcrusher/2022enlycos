## What is Cement and How it is Manufactured? The Machine Design
A cement is a binding substance, used to bind other buildings or civil construction material like bricks, stones, gravels, tiles, etc. Cement can be set and hardened independently and can bind other building materials together. It is a very fine powder containing limestone, clay, silica, and alumina. Also contained with bauxite and iron oxide.

There are three steps of the hightemperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.

The cement from silos is fed to the packer machines. Most of the modern plants have electric packing plant having provision to account for the weights of empty bags of different types and to ensure a 50 kg net weight of cement bag within ± 200 g limit. Each bag of cement contains 50 kg or 500 N or about 0.035 m 3 of cement.
