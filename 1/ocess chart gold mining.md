## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining Earthworks
Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.

Costs in the gold mining industry increased for the second consecutive quarter in Q1'21, with the global average Allin Sustaining Cost (AISC) up by 5% qoq to US$1,048/oz, reaching its highest level since Q2'13. This, combined with a 4% fall in the average quarterly gold price, resulted in a 14% drop in AISC margins (the gold price minus AISC) between Q4'20 and Q1'21.

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
