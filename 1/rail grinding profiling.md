The only remedy for such defects is grinding. A typical Rail Grinding train consists of a series of vehicles equipped with grindstones, which form a grinding effect on the rails surface, thus producing smooth surfaces and eliminating rail irregularities on specific profiles. Rail profiling is done to keep larger contact bands at the wheel
