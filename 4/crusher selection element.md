## Cone crushers for demanding crushing needs Metso Outotec
Cone crushers are suitable for all demanding crushing needs. Cone crushers are very suitable for size reduction and shaping in the downstream of a crushing circuit. They reduce the material in a crushing cavity by continuous compression between a fixed element (bowl liner) and a moving element (mantle).

The Discrete element method (DEM) is an invaluable tool for studying comminution as it provides detailed information that can help with process analysis as well as trying out new equipment designs before the equipment is physically built. The DEM was used to analyse previous experimental work to gain some insight into the comminution process in an impact crusher with a single impeller.
