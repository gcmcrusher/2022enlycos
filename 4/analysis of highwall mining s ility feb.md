Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## CDC Mining Toward Pillar Design To Prevent Collapse of Roomand 
In some instances, extensive roomandpillar workings can collapse with little warning and pose a serious risk to underground miners. Traditional strengthbased pillar design methods applicable to coal or hardrock mines use a factor of safety defined as pillar strength divided by pillar stress. Factor of stability, defined as local mine

Variants of open pit mining are limited to a number of other surface mining methods, which include strip mining, high wall mining, and quarrying. Strip (open cast) mining is used extensively for the surface mining of important commodities such as coal and phosphate ores. Casting is the process of excavation and dumping into a final location.
