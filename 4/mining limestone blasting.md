## Wirtgen surface miners offer limestone mining without drilling and blasting
The raw material for the cement plant comes from a deposit located 15 km to the north. The Carpathian mining area is rich in sedimentary rocks such as limestone, marl and gypsum. Production increase thanks to Wirtgen technologies. For years, the material was extracted by drilling and blasting and then wetprocessed into clinker in the cement plant.
