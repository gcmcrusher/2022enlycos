## Coal transport continues to face challenges: Ministry
In January this year, the Union Power Ministry had said that India would need 615 million tonnes of coal in 201819 and that would require staterun Coal India Limited (CIL) to send average 288 rakes per day through railways. However, according to Coal Ministry data, average overall loading has been 270.8 rakes per day as on October 21, 2018.
