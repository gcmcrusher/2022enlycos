The Abitibi is the world's largest mineralrich greenstone geological belt, hosting many major gold and base metal deposits. It is a 450 km long by 150 km wide geological structure that runs through the Canadian Shield, from west of Timmins, Ontario, then eastward to Chibougamau, Quebec. Gold was found in the area in the late 1800's, but

The AbitibiGreenstone belt has created a natural eastwest link across the two provinces. Communities along the fault lines share common links of history, work and identity. Indeed the whole opening up of Northwestern Quebec to mining is a direct result of the movement of prospectors and miners along the lines of the AbitibiGreenstone belt.

## Processes in the Neoarchean Abitibi Greenstone Belt
This review focuses on the Abitibi greenstone belt because it is a goldendowed belt that contains several Au and CuAu porphyry deposits formed during the ~100 My magmatic phase that ends at ca. 2.70 Ga (see below) prior to the main deformation phase. In addition, the Abitibi belt contains pre to syndeformation (ca. 2.70–2.65 Ga, see below)

The AGB is a 150 km wide greenstone belt that stretches for 650 km across Eastern Canada, from Wawa, Ontario in the west to Val d'Or, Quebec in the east. The area has produced over 180,000,000 ounces of gold and more than 450,000,000 tons of CuZn ore since the early 1900's. About one third on the belt is in the province of Ontario with the

The Abitibi greenstone belt is a 2,800to2,600millionyearold greenstone belt that spans across the Ontario–Quebec border in Canada. It is mostly made of volcanic rocks, but also includes ultramafic rocks, mafic intrusions, granitoid rocks, and early and middle Precambrian sediments.. Geographical extent. The Abitibi greenstone belt is one of the world's largest Archean greenstone belts.
