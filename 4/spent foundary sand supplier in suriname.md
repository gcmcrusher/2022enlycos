## How U.S. metal foundries can save $40 million a year
Reusing 10 percent of the 10 million tons of spent foundry sand sent to landfills every year can save U.S. foundries about $40 million annually. That's based on an average disposal cost of $40 a ton. The potential savings for Ohio and U.S. foundries will be a leg up in an increasingly competitive international market.

## What are Green Sand Castings? Willman Industries
Green Sand Castings are castings made using wet sand or "green sand" molds. The sand is not green in color nor do the molds use "greensand," a greenish color sandstone. Instead the sand is called "green" because it has moisture in it (like green wood) before the sand dries out when molten metal is poured in the mold.
