## The Future of Tantalum and Niobium Mining Technology
Indeed, until the discovery of the world's pyrochlore deposits in the 1950s, niobium was a byproduct of tantalum mining, with increasing demand ensuring that it was highly valued and highly priced. All of the world's main tantalite mines are hosted in pegmatite ore bodies, including Wodgina, Greenbushes, Marropino and Bernic Lake in Canada.

About Tantalite Hide. Formula: (Mn,Fe) (Ta,Nb)2O6. An obsolete group name for minerals with the general formula (Mn,Fe) (Ta,Nb) 2 O 6, equivalent to the Tantalite (Fe)Tantalite (Mn) Series. Generally mangandominant members are more abundant in nature. Many specimens called tantalite actually belong to the columbite series or tapiolite series.
