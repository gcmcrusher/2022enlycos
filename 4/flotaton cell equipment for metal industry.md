Mechanical flotation cells can be broken down into two broad categories based on how air is introduced to the cell. In a self aspirated flotation cell air is introduced to the slurry, the vacuum created by the rotorusing . In a forced air flotation cell air is generated external to the cell by a low pressure blower,, and pumped down the
