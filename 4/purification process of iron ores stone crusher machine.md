Inside the ball mill, the crushed iron ore will grind the ore to about 0.2 mm with 3inch steel balls. 3.This iron ore slurry is pumped to the agitation tank. This iron ore slurry is finally pumped to the flotation machine with the fine sulfide ore (~0.074 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of iron.
