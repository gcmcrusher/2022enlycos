During the washing and beneficiation of coal or any minerals, particulates become suspended in waste water. Before reuse of these discharged waters, suspended particulates and various contaminants must be removed from this effluent. Coal washery consume huge amount of water and hence generates huge amount of waste water. If this water is directly discharged into streams, it will cause
