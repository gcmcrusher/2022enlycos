Mining remains an essential and growing part of the modern industry. By some estimates, it makes up nearly 45% of the total global economy, and mineral production continues to increase as demand for raw materials grows around the world.. However, many mining techniques still in use can have serious impacts on both the mining site itself and the surrounding environment.
