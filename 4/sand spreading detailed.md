Seafloor spreading is a geologic process in which tectonic plates —large slabs of Earth's lithosphere —split apart from each other. Seafloor spreading and other tectonic activity processes are the result of mantle convection. Mantle convection is the slow, churning motion of Earth's mantle. Convection currents carry heat from the lower mantle and core to the lithosphere.
