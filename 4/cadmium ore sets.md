What happens to Cadmium in the environment? Cadmium is released by various natural and anthropogenic sources to the atmosphere, the aquatic and terrestrial environments, mostly in the form of particles. Cadmium can be released naturally by volcanoes or by the weathering of rocks; it can also come from human activities, namely mining and the production, use and disposal of products containing
