Clay is a type of finegrained natural soil material containing clay minerals. Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing. Most pure clay minerals are white or lightcoloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or brownish colour
