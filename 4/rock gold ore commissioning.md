Fill it up about halfway and then place the rock in the water (assuming it's small enough to do so). You can measure how big the rock is by how much water is displaced. If the water line moves up 3/4 of a cup then that's how big the rock is. You can use Google to convert that volume to cubic centimeters.

Gold Ore Mining Techniques. For the average smallscale prospector, there are just a few methods that work well to locate gold in rock. First, I always recommend that you carry a gold pan and sample the gravels in the area. Even in a desert, you can dig down into a dry wash and pack in some water to use while panning.

When you mix the finely powdered goldbearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
