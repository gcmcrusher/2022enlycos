## Electromagnetic Vibratory Feeders Provide Precision to Your Bulk 
The electromagnetic feeder's primary function is to precisely regulate feed rates of dry bulk solid materials out of hoppers. They then move the material, sometimes spreading it out, onto a downstream piece of equipment. This equipment can include belt conveyors, screening machines, crushers, dryers or other pieces of process equipment.

## Study on Magnetite Ore Crushing Assisted by Microwave Irradiation MDPI
When impact crushers and hammer crushers crush ore, the rotation speed of the center rotor (which determines the impact speed of the hammer) is related to the size of the material. Under the influence of electromagnetic oscillation, the polar molecules in the material will undergo ultrahigh frequency polar motion.

## Crushing Jaw Crusher Discharge Opening Width Determines How
Mar 28, 2019 The size of a jaw crusher is measured by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 48 x 42 jaw crusher measures 48 from one crushing jaw to another and is 42 across the width of the two crushers. The primary applications for using jaw crushers are Crushing different kinds of ore Reducing building rubble to pieces
