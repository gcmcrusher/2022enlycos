## Mill Building Design Procedure American Institute of Steel  AISC
Bakota, John F. (1977). "Mill Building Design Procedure," Engineering Journal, American Institute of Steel Construction, Vol. 14, pp. 130137. The design of an industrial mill building involves myriad assumptions and parameters. In the current state of the art, there is disagreement about the validity of many of these assumptions and parameters.

4.2.3.1.1 Roll Mills. The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.
