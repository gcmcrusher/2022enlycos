Iron ores obtained from different sources differ in their chemical and physical properties. These variations make the process of grinding a difficult task. The work carried out in this context focuses on three different samples of iron ore, viz., high silica high alumina, low silica high alumina, and low silica low alumina. The grinding process for all the three iron ores is carried out

Steel is a multicomponent metal containing primarily ferrum (Fe), carbon (from 0.025% to 2.14%), additives and alloys. Semifinished steel products include square billets, blooms, beam blanks, slabs and rounds that are used to hotroll sections, flat products and pipes. Coke and chemicals include products from coke and chemical plants.
