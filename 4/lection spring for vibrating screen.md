## Vibrating Screen RHEWUM
Vibrating Screen RHEsono ®. Vibrating screening machines of the type RHEsono ® are used for precise screening in the fine to medium grain range and are equipped with an automatic cleaning system.. A highfrequency knocker shaft movement throws the screening material off the screen mesh at a 90° angle the inclination of the mesh enables the screening material to be transported over the screen.

Enhanced by resonance, one drive can produce two vibration movements. The screen box is accelerated approximately 2g's while the screen mats can receive up to 50g's.
