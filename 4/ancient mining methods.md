## Mining Techniques of the Sierra Nevada and Gold Country
In the beginning, the goldbearing quartz was wrenched from underground veins by backbreaking, dimly lit sweat and blood. However, imported miners from Cornwall and Wales adapted ancient European mining techniques and brought modern technology to the enterprise. The miners followed the veins and blasted the gold from the quartz.

## A Brief History of Mining: The Advancement of Mining Techniques and 
Since civilization began, people have used mining techniques to access minerals in the surface of the Earth. Discoveries have shown that flint pebbles were extracted from deposits in France and Britain as far back as the New Stone Age. Ancient Egyptians mined copper as far back as 3000 BCE. In the earliest days, mining was slowgoing and dangerous.

The story of silver mining began about 5,000 years ago. Silver was first mined around 3,000 BCE in Anatolia, now located in modernday Turkey. The precious metal helped early civilizations in the Near East, Ancient Greece to flourish. In about 1,200 BCE the center of silver production shifted to Greece's Laurium mines, where it continued to

The methods used by the Roman miners are described by Pliny the Elder in his work Naturalis Historia published in about 77 AD.

The price of mining gold took a leap when the Romans developed hydraulic mining in the Spanish mines. Rivers were rechanneled and destroyed. Strabo wrote that this method produced more gold than the deep mines. Some of the Roman mines in Spain were 650 feet deep. Slaves in the mines never saw the light of day.

Likely mine sites were identified by surface finds. Ore was extracted and removed by iron hand tools, and lifted up the shaft using a rope. In the 16th century, miners were still using firesetting and wooden trays. In 1600 years, mining technology progressed very little beyond the Roman practices.

Summary. Historically, the majority of gold was mined from "placer deposits", where gold has settled out of an existing or ancient waterway downstream of where nuggets had eroded out of rock outcrops.Some early miners also used an early form of hardrock mining, digging solid veins of gold out of rock, where mineralized water had deposited it over thousands of years.
