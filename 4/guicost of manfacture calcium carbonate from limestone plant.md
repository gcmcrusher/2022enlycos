Quicklime is an essential reducing agent in the steel smelting process and its calcination from limestone is accompanied by considerable energy consumption. As a relatively economical lime kiln, the Parallel Flow Regenerative (PFR) lime kiln is used as the main equipment for the production of quicklime by various steel industries. PFR lime kilns generally use natural gas as the fuel gas.
