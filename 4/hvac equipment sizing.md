A BTU is what's required to heat or cool one pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. For example, your home's square footage total, including all floors and ceilings, is what determines what size what size HVAC unit you need. For every 500 BTUs required for your home, you will need approximately one ton of air conditioning or heating capacity (1
