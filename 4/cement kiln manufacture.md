## Portland Cement Manufacturing – Ordinary Portland Cement Production AGICO
Portland cement manufacturing process can be divided into 6 steps: raw material crushing, prehomogenization, fine grinding, clinker production, cement grinding, cement packing, etc. In these processes, we need the assistance of different kinds of cement equipment, such as cement kilns, cement mills, and cement crushers.

CEMENT MANUFACTURE. The cementmaking process can be divided into two basic steps: Clinker (the main constituent of cement) is first made in a kiln with gas up to 2000°C, which heats raw materials such as limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials (e.g. clay) to 1,450°C.

Manufacturing the cement kiln. Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln. Basically, this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two. The axis is inclined at a slight angle, the end with the burner being lower. The rotation causes the raw meal to gradually pass along from where it enters at the cool end, to the
