## How to Adjust the Gap between the Die and Roller? Pellet Press
Adjusting the Gap between the Die and Roller. The gap between the rollers and the die determines the granulating effect of the stock and amount of wear on the parts. This gap is typically set at 0.05 to 0.3 mm. If the gap exceeds 0.3 mm the material will spread in a thick and nonuniform manner across the die causing poor pellet quality.
