## A Review of the Scope of Artisanal and Small‐Scale Mining Worldwide 
Some of the poorest people in the world's poorest countries eke out a living in artisanal and small‐scale mining (ASM). Equipped with primitive tools like picks, shovels, buckets, and gold pans, they work mining valuable resources, like gold, diamonds, tin, lithium, rare earth elements, tantalum, and cobalt, and any other usable commodity, for example, sand, coal, or mica.

Crushers work on the ground in a sitting position, either with their legs stretched out or bent with knees up wards and the body bending forward. Crushing is done on a hard stone with several hammer hits to separate the ore from impurities: the crusher holds the mineralized rock in place with his fingers and hits it with the hammer.

Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the highspeed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again. This process is repeated until the material is

An artisanal miner or smallscale miner (ASM) is a subsistence miner who is not officially employed by a mining company, but works independently, mining minerals using their own resources, usually by hand.. Smallscale mining includes enterprises or individuals that employ workers for mining, but generally still using manuallyintensive methods, working with hand tools.

In such a case when it is located far away, the cost of transport of stone from the quarry to constructional sites may become too heavy. At the same time, a quarry must not be located very close to a town because quarrying operations are full of hazards. This becomes especially important when blasting method has to be used for quarrying of stones.

## Artisanal and SmallScale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and smallscale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with goldcontaining materials, forming a mercurygold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

Estimation of the respective productivities of men and women stone crushers in Artisanal and Small Scale Granite Quarries was carried out by collecting data from sample sites and conducting statistical treatment of collected data. An analysis of the results shows that the productivities of men and women stone crushers are 1.1 and 0.6 tonnes per day.
