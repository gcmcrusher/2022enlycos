The step reduction of hot flue gas flow rate was simulated. The dynamic responses of live and reheat steam temperatures were obtained and analyzed.

The critical component of the boiler equipment is the mill, with an average ACR value of 7.81. The distribution of coal is carried out directly from the barge to the boiler bunker. The coal sample is carried out at least five times at the coal feeder inlet, and coal quality is determined through proximate analysis using Bomb Calorimeter

Agglomeration. Agglomeration problem mainly occurs on the fireside in the fluidized bed boilers [ 27 ]. Agglomeration is basically the ashrelated problem of biomassfired boilers. Ashes which are formed from highsulfur and lowash fuel agglomerate, if they are prone to sulfating condition for long time.

Boiler slag resembles the size of gravel. It makes up about 2% of coal combustion waste. Generally, these wastes are only slightly more radioactive than the average soil in the United States. The amount of natural radiation in wastes from coalfired power plants is so small that no precautions need to be taken.
