•After the stone is dumped into the feed chute from above, gravity moves it down through the crusher, which reduces it to about 3 inches in diameter. A bag filter helps reduce airborne dust. •From the crusher, the stone moves onto a conveyor belt that carries it to the manufacturing plant about 6 kms away in our case.
