## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching – An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au 8 NaCN O 2 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining Earthworks
A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

Cyanide leach mining is a type of gold mining that uses cyanide to extract gold from the surrounding rock. First, the rock that contains gold (the ore) is dug out of the ground, leaving behind a large open pit. Then, the ore is crushed into small pieces. The crushed ore is placed in large piles, called heaps, and sprayed with cyanide solution.

What is cyanide and why do we need cyanidefree gold leaching process? Cyanide (CN –) has been used since 1889 to recover gold from hard rock. As sodium cyanide (NaCN), it reacts with gold, oxygen (O), and water (H 2 O) to form a gold cyanide complex (Na [Au(CN) 2] ) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The chemical reaction dubbed the "Elsner Equation", named after its discoverer, is shown below:
