Bulk Density of Sand Civil Engineering. The approximate bulk density of sand that is commonly used in normalweight concrete is between kg/m 3 (95105 lb/ft 3) [1] Here, Standard test method for determining the bulk density of sand is given in ASTM C 29 (AASHTO T 19). [2] References. More

## Density of Construction Materials ( 59 Materials List) : Glass, Silt 
The density of construction materials is the ratio of mass per unit volume. It shows the compactness of construction material. Its unit is kg/m³ or lb/ft³.. It is represented by row (p).. Lower dense materials occupy more volume as compared to high dense materials.

## Laboratory and Field Performance of stabilized soft subgrade
From Fig V it is observed that the density affected due to decrease of robosand content. As expected low density of fly ash than robo sand has affected the density of mixture. The reason of decrease in density can be substantiated with the trend shown for OMC i.e, increase with fly ash. The addition of fly ash adds more fines resulting increase
