## The Design of a Pedal Driven Pulverizing and Sieving Machine for 
Abstract The postharvest operation of cassava is still being done manually and therefore labour intensive. The need to mechanize this process makes it necessary to have a machine that will perform some of these processes. This paper presents the design of a pedal driven pulverizing and sieving machine for dewatered grated cassava.

Attempts at breaking through the drudgery involved in traditional sieving process employing motorized sieving machines have not been fully achieved. Over 92% of garri producers still use the traditional raffia sieve for pulverizing and sifting operation [4,2] with a negligible percentage of motorized sieving machine under trial [5,6].
