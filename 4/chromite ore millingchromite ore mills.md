The process of chromite ore mining can be divided into 2 areas: 1. Feed preparation. 2. Concentration. The feed preparation stage involves the introduction of various physical separation equipment including crushers, screens and grinding mills. The principal function of this stage is size reduction in preparation for the concentration phase.

## WOA1 Recovery of pgms and chromite from mixed pgm  Google
This invention relates to a process for the enhanced recovery of chromite and platinum group metals (PGMs) from a mixed chromite/PGM ore. Ore is ground 12, classified 14, to produce a coarse fraction and a fine fraction 36. The coarse fraction is subjected to gravity separation 16 and coarse particle flotation 20 to obtain a chrome concentrate and a PGM concentrate.
