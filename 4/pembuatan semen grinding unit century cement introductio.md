A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

G. Habert, in Ecoefficient Construction and Building Materials, 2014 10.1 Introduction. Cement production has undergone tremendous developments since its beginnings some 2,000 years ago. While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history (Malinowsky, 1991), the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century, first with shaft kilns, which were later

Cement was later reinvented by the Greeks and the Babylonians who made their mortar out of lime. Later, the Romans produced cement from pozzolan, an ash found in all of the volcanic areas of Italy, by mixing the ash with lime. Cement is a fine grayish powder which, when mixed with water, forms a thick paste.

Cements may be used alone (i.e., "neat," as grouting materials), but the normal use is in mortar and concrete in which the cement is mixed with inert material known as aggregate.Mortar is cement mixed with sand or crushed stone that must be less than approximately 5 mm (0.2 inch) in size. Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand or other fine aggregate, and a coarse aggregate that for most
