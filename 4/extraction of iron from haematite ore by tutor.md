Iron is the most widely used metal in the world, mainly in the form of steel. The main. ore of iron is called haematite. It is a mineral composed of iron (III) oxide, Fe 2 O 3. About 4.12% (or 4.15%) of earth's crust is Iron. Mainly Fe is extracted from oxide ore. Commercially Fe is extracted from Haematite by three steps: Condensation.

Iron is extracted from its ore, haematite in a blast furnace. The ore is led into the top of the furnace along with coke and limestone. The limestone decomposes in the hot furnace, forming calcium oxide. In the extraction of iron from haematite, the charge used is composed of haematite, coke and lime stone, in the weight ratio: Medium.
