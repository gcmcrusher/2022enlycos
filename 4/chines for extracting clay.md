5. Boosts Immune Function. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated cat claw's powerful immuneboosting abilities.In one animal study, researchers gave subjects a watersoluble extract of cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa) for eight weeks.They found that this supplementation significantly elevated subjects' infectionfighting white blood cell count.

## The impact of unregulated ionic clay rare earth mining in China
The Chinese refer to ionic clay miners in three ways: white, grey and black. White miners are fully regulated by the Chinese government. They follow governmental environmental guidelines for the extraction and processing of ionic clays and are not the subject of this paper. It is the grey and black miners that lay outside government management.

## How RareEarth Mining Has Devastated China's Environment
About 35% of the world's reserves of rareearth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

William Cookworthy was aware that if he could only find kaolin in the UK he would be sitting on a goldmine. He searched the country and in 1746 he finally found a deposit of a similar standard to the Chinese kaolin, here in Cornwall. Earning it the nickname of china clay. The deposit required work to extract it from the degraded granite.

Kaolin clay, commonly known as China clay, is a naturally occurring clay that is mainly found in soil that has formed as a result of rock weathering. The mineral kaolinite, a hydrous aluminium silicate produced by the breakdown of minerals like feldspar, is the main component of kaolin. Kaolin comes from the Chinese word kaolin, which meaning "high ridge." The term "high ridge" refers to the
