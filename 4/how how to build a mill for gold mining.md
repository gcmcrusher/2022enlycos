The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

A stamp mill is a mechanical device used to separate gold from rocks and ore. It features a number of sizable steel stamps. These stamps are attached to powerful battering arms, which raise and lower the stamps. When the stamps are lowered they come crashing down with a powerful force, crushing the material beneath them.
