A single toggle jaw crusher consists of an eccentric shaft that is placed on the top of the crusher. The rotation of the shaft along with the toggle plate generates the necessary compression force required to break down the substance into smaller particles. A single toggle jaw crusher has a better capacity than a double toggle jaw crusher.
