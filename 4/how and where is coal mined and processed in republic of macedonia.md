## Geohazards at Surface Coal Mines Caused by Mining Activities
Abstract. This chapter presents a methodology of geohazard analyses caused by mining activities at coal mine "Suvodol" near the town Bitola in the Republic of Macedonia. The problems discussed here are connected with landslide with enormous dimensions. The process of sliding happened in several phases, with initial signs of sliding in 1993.

Coal ranked as the mostmined mineral in the world, yet worldwide coal production fell to 7.4 billion tons in 2016 from 8.2 billion in 2012. While coal production has increased in Australia and Russia in the last five years, both South Africa and the U.S. have seen sharp declines in production of anthracite and bituminous coal.

## What Are The Major Natural Resources Of Macedonia?
The country's average consumption is 7.6 million tons of which about 95% is used in power generation. With the current level of consumption, Macedonia is expected to start importing coal from 2025 since some of the current mines are quickly running out of coal deposits. Half of the coal imported will likely go into electricity production.
