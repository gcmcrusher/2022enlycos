## Metallurgical Coal
Metallurgical coal – also known as coking coal, is a key ingredient for the production of steel by creating the coke necessary during the reduction process of making iron and steel. Coke is a porous, hard black rock of concentrated carbon that is created by heating bituminous coal without air to extremely high temperatures.

Coking proceeds for 15 hours to 18 hours to produce BF coke. During this period, VM of coal distills out as raw coke oven gas. The time of coking is determined by the coal blend, moisture content, rate of under firing, and the desired properties of the coke. When demand for coke is low, coking times can be increased to 24 hours.
