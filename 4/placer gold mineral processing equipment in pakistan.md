The presence of gold telluride minerals may render an ore refractory, the extent of this depends on the telluride mineral present and the mineralogical association [3]. Gold, silver, and gold/silvertelluride minerals in ores dissolve more slowly than native gold in cyanide solutions, which results in less efficient gold extraction [4]. Inquire Now

1. Rock gold is the most common form of pure gold. Gold is hidden in the quartz veins in the rock, we need to find the goldbearing rocks first, then exploit the ore, crush them into ore powder, and then purify them by gravity or flotation. 2. The placer gold is easy to mine. The process of rock gold mining is relatively complicated and difficult.

About Placer Gold. Placer gold refers to the gold formed by the rock gold in the mountain washed by the river and separated from the quartz vein. Because this kind of gold is as fine as sand, it is called placer gold. Gold mining is divided into rock cave digging and panning in rivers and streams containing gold. For example, gold taken from mines is called gold or melon seed gold, and gold
