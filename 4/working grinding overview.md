Most surface grinding operations use wheel speeds of 30–35 m s1. High speed (high efficiency) grinding is a rapid metalremoving process using special wheels with speeds of 100 m s1. Grinding machines must have special requirements such as rigidity, high work speeds, high power and special safety provisions.

While 85 to 90 percent of the workrest blades are carbidetipped materials, other materials, such as ceramic and bronze, are sometimes used. The blade angle varies by application—going from a flat blade for some bar grinding operations to as high as 45° for some small, intricate finishing work, but the most common angle used is 30°.

Grinding force ratio is a parameter that gives indirect information about the efficiency of grinding. Force ratio is defined as: (2.8) μ μ = F t / F n grinding force ratio. When grinding with sharp wheels grinding force ratio is high since normal force is low compared to tangential force. Conversely, when grinding with blunt wheels grinding

Grinding and Polishing. Adapted from the 3rd edition, Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety. Grinding generally involves the use of a bonded abrasive to wear away parts of a workpiece. The aim is to give the work a certain shape, correct its dimensions, increase the smoothness of a surface or improve the sharpness of cutting edges.

Infeed grinding: The workpiece is inserted from the top or the side into the grinding zone and positioned by an axial stop. This is achieved by a slight inclination of the regulating wheel (0.1°–0.2°) Throughfeed grinding: The workpieces run continuously through the grinding zone by axial feed force.

Conventional grinding tools, i.e., grinding tools made of Al 2 O 3 or SiC abrasives, should be dressed primarily with relatively low depths of cut, 5 μm < a ed < 25 μm (applies to grits between 60 μm, or #220, and 350 μm, or #46), and always in one direction. Otherwise, the grinding tool microstructure will be weakened, resulting in cracks in the abrasive grits and vitrified bond.
