## Vibratory Feeder: What Is It? How Does It Work? Types Of IQS Directory
The general design of a vibratory feeder consists of a drive unit that generates the vibratory action and a deep channel, or trough, that contains the bulk material. Vibratory feeders can be classified according to their drive unit, method of applying vibration to the trough, and generated reaction to the supporting structures.
