## Noise is "amplified" by temperature inversions Kunda Park neighbours
A temperature inversion is when the temperature is coolest right next to the ground and warmer as you increase in height above the ground. Since the temperature increases with height, the speed of sound also increases with height. This means that for a sound wave traveling close to the ground, the part of the wave closest to the ground is

The water is exposed to air as it flows throughout the cooling tower. The air is being pulled by an motordriven electric "cooling tower fan". When the air and water come together, a small volume of water evaporates, creating an action of cooling. The colder water gets pumped back to the process/equipment that absorbs heat or the condenser.

How Concrete is Made. In its simplest form, concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates, or rocks. The paste, composed of portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration, the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rocklike mass known as concrete.
