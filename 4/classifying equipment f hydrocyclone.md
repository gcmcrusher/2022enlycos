Solution: 1). If the ore feeding pressure fluctuates due to the drop of the liquid level in the pump tank, it can be adjusted by increasing the liquid level, or closing one or two cyclones, or reducing the pump speed; 2).If the feeding pressure fluctuates due to pump blockage or wear, the pump needs to be overhauled. 2.The hydrocyclone is blocked.

Hydrocyclone is an effective fine particle classifing equipment in the present mineral processing equipment. Its structure is relatively simple, with a cylinder on the top and a conical container on the bottom. The slurry is fed into the hydrocyclone at a certain speed along the tangential direction, which generates a large centrifugal force due to the rotary motion.

It is obvious that the floor area of hydrocyclone is significantly smaller than that of the spiral classifier. Usually, the hydrocyclone covers an area of only l/30 to l/50 to the spiral classifier. The equipment floor area requirement also limits the application of the spiral classifier to a certain extent. 3. Classification Efficiency.

Hydrocyclone/ cyclone filter is mainly used for classification, separation, concentration, and desliming in the mineral mining industry. When the hydrocyclone is used as a classifier, it is mainly used to form a grinding and classification system with a mill; when it is used as a deslimer, it can be used for desliming in a gravity concentrator

Hydrocyclone classifier. An involute mode is used at the material inlet for material infeed. It increases the centrifugal force of the materials, improves the classification effect and lessens the wearing of the feed box. By using an involute mode, the hydrocyclone caused by a sudden spread when the materials enter the cyclone will be reduced.

The third type of classification used in mining is the Hydrocyclone, commonly called a Cyclone. Unlike the others it has no moving parts and is worked in conjunction of another piece of equipment, a pump. To understand the Hydrocyclone Working Principle we must first know its components. Beginning at the top, there is the OVERFLOW DISCHARGE.
