In beneficiation of graphite by the method of flotation, it has been almost impossible to avoid the entrainment of gangues such as sericite into graphite concentrate. Hence, to solve the aforementioned problem, the use of Nigrosin (C 22 H 16 N 6 O 3) as a depressant for graphite in leadzinc ore processing technology was introduced recently .

## A graphite beneficiation benchmark in the making Miningreview
A graphite beneficiation benchmark in the making. Londonbased flake graphite company Tirupati Graphite, through its Madagascan portfolio of natural flake graphite projects, is targeting the production of 81 000 tpa of processed flake graphite production by 2021. The company's ambitions don't stop there as its ultimate aim is to further
