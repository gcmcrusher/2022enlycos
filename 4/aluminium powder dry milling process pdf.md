## Aluminium production process
At an aluminium smelter, alumina is poured into special reduction cells with molten cryolite at 950℃. Electric currents are then induced in the mixture at 400 kA or above; this current breaks the bond between the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in liquid aluminium settling at the bottom of the reduction cell.

Aluminium powder is powdered aluminium.. Originally produced by mechanical means using a stamp mill to create flakes, a process of spraying molten aluminium to create a powder of droplets was subsequently developed by E. J. Hall in the 1920s. The resulting powder might then be processed further in a ball mill to flatten it into flakes for use as a coating or pigment.

## [PDF] Mechanical milling of aluminum powder using planetary ball 
The process can be performed at room temperature and homogeneous nanocomposite powders can be produced. In this paper, we investigated the effect of different ball milling parameters and operating conditions (milling time, ball size, processing control agent (PCA) and speed) in mechanical alloying of aluminum powder to achieve particle size..

## Can You Powder Coat Aluminum? Process and Comparison. Fine MetalWorking
Yes, aluminum can be powder coated. Some manufacturers warn that the powder coating process could harm the metal's integrity, but this depends on the powder coating methods being used. When carried out correctly, powder coating will not harm aluminum, and the resultant finish will improve the part's corrosion resistance, wear resistance

## Manufacturing of aluminum flake powder from foil scrap by dry ball 
The milling time, the ball size (diameter 9.6 or 16 mm), the number of intermediate stops during milling for 25 h, and the content of stearic acid were varied in the dry ball milling process. Aluminum flake powder of 1 g during the milling was sampled and characterized. The mean size, the size distribution and the specific surface area of
