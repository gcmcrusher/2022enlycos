## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem ThoughtCo
How Mercury Is Used in Gold Mining . The Philippines and part of Western Africa's coast (e.g., Ghana) are particularly impacted by the phenomenon. Under the socioeconomic and political conditions found in the smallscale gold mining operation, the use of mercury is often considered as the easiest and most costeffective solution for gold
