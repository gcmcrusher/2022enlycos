## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining Process
Generally, gold can be refined using these twobestknown goldrefining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. You can freshly prepared Aqua Regia by mixing concentrated hydrochloric acid with concentrated nitric acid. Aqua Regia gets its royal name from its ability to dissolve some noble metals such as gold and platinum. The diagram

## Why use hydrochloric instead of nitric acid? ECHEMI
Why use hydrochloric instead of nitric acid? It depends on the application. In many reactions, nitric acid partially breaks down, yielding toxic NO₂ fumes. (Though there are reactions where HCl yields Cl₂, which can be even less "fun".) If you need the acid anions to remain in the solution, in usual reactions, it may be better to use HCl.
