Pulverized coal burners are stocked with ignition devices and sensors which selectively control the burner's torch. Currently, two types of vane swirlers are used for twisting secondary air: axial and tangential. Depending on parameters determining the quality of coal such as ash, abrasiveness and reactivity, either axial vane or scroll
