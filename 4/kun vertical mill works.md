## China Kunqu Opera: Tune, Roles, Where to Watch
Kunqu Opera was originally developed in Kunshan over 600 years ago. It outshone other opera styles for 300 years in ancient times. Its tune was improved by folk musician Wei Liangfu in the 1500s during the Ming Dynasty (1368 1644 AD). Later, in the middle of the Qing Dynasty (1644 1911 AD), it began to decline. There was no professional team to perform Kun Opera before 1949.

The science behind how milling machines work is similar to how a drill works. As a drill is pressed down on a workpiece, the material being hit by the cutter is removed from the workpiece from a both a vertical direction and angle. Instead, with milling the "drill" in this instance keeps the same angle but moves sideways.
