A grinding machine or grinder is an industrial power tool that uses an abrasive wheel for cutting or removing the m aterial. It is a process of metal cutting by using a rotating abrasive whee l from the surface of the workpiece. Generally, the grinding is finishing operation to show the high surface quality, accuracy of the shape and dimension.

While diamond grinding is effective at leveling an uneven surface, it is not an efficient method for flattening a nonflat surface. If your concrete area features a crack or damaged section that is creating a protrusion or tripping hazard, the amount of grinding necessary to flatten the area will cost more in equipment and material costs, and likely result in unevenness in other areas as a result.
