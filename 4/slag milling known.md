What is slag? In modern steel making, slags originate in a blast furnace from impurities in the iron ores (known as the gangue), the flux and coke ash. This is a complex mixture of silica, alumina, sulfides and oxides of calcium and magnesium, as well as smaller amounts of manganese and iron oxides.
