## Mesh and Micron Sizes Chart ISM Industrial Spec
Figuring out the mesh number is simple. All you do is count the number of openings in one linear inch of screen. This count is the mesh number. A 4mesh screen means there are four little square openings across one inch of screen. A 100mesh screen has 100 openings per inch, and so on. As the number indicating the mesh size increases, the size
