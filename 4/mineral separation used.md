The separation is done in a separating funnel in a temperature controlled room of 20°C. The "heavy" grains will accumulate in the bottom of the funnel above the pinch clip and the "lighter" grains float to the surface. After 6 – 8 hours of separation the pinch clip is opened and the heavy minerals are drained onto a filter paper.
