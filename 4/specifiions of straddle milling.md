## What is Straddle Milling Difference Between Straddle Milling and Gang 
Straddle milling can be used in cutting spline, or squares and hexagons on the end of a cylindrical part. Straddle milling uses sharp milling cutters on either side, it is possible to machine the pieces on opposite sides to parallel in a cut. The indexing head will be utilized to rotate the piece after each cut.

Straddle milling. In straddle milling, two or more parallel vertical surfaces are machined at a single cut, which is accomplished by mounting two milling cutters on the same arbor, set apart at the exact width of the workpiece. The two sides of the workpiece are machined at the same time with the dimensions being exactly and precisely controlled.
