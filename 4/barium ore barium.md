Barite is the primary ore of barium, which is used to make a wide variety of barium compounds. Some of these are used for xray shielding. Barite has the ability to block xray and gammaray emissions. Barite is used to make highdensity concrete to block xray emissions in hospitals, power plants, and laboratories.

Recently, there are many orders. Due to the tight supply of raw ore, the spot in the field is slightly tight, and the price trend of fluorite in the field remains high. Recently, some fluorite manufacturers shut down their units for maintenance, and the mine and flotation operation in the field have declined slightly.
