The most common are carbide and highspeed steel. You may choose to use highspeed steel (HSS) for general purpose milling. But, opt for carbide to machine tougher and harder tool steels. Cutting Speed, Feed Rate, Depth. Cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut are all parameters to consider when machining.

## Multiobjective Optimization of Milling Parameters for Ultrahigh 
In this paper, ultrahighstrength steel AF1410 was milled with the carbide tool, and a total of thirty experiments were performed based on central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology. The prediction models of milling force and surface roughness are established, respectively. The influence of milling parameters (milling speed, each tooth feed, radial depth of cut, and axial
