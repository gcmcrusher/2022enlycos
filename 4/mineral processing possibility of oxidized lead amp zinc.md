## zinc processing Ores Britannica
Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world, although more than 40 percent of the world's output originates in North America and Australia. The common zinccontaining minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS), a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S], and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or smithsonite (ZnCO3). The geology of zinc

## Lead PUB0659 Missouri Department of Natural Resources
Commodity Lead is a soft, very dense, ductile, malleable, and corrosionresistant metal. Lead currently is produced in Missouri from multiple mines in the southeastern part of the state, where it is found associated with zinc, copper and silver. Lead was named from the word "plumbum," Latin for "liquid silver," and which provided the source for lead's chemical symbol of Pb.

The process is based in the fact that lead can be oxidized at high temperatures and precious metals no. under this consideration, the separation is possible. The initial temperature is 860880 oC and the final is at 900920 o C. Cupels must be capable of resist high temperatures, absorb oxides, but no liquid metals.

Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist.
