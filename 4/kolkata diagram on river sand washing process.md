1. Raise the pan out of the water. Make sure there is about an inch of water left in the pan. The water is necessary because you will continue to sift the sand from the gold when the pan is taken out of the stream. 2. Tilt the pan towards you slightly. Swirl the water and materials slowly in a circle.

## How does sand form? National Ocean Service
Sand forms when rocks break down from weathering and eroding over thousands and even millions of years. Rocks take time to decompose, especially quartz (silica) and feldspar. Often starting thousands of miles from the ocean, rocks slowly travel down rivers and streams, constantly breaking down along the way. Once they make it to the ocean, they

There is a constant flow of sand from the land into the ocean. Sand is washed ashore with waves and blown inland forming sand dunes. There are dramatic seasonal changes in sand movement: highenergy winter storm waves pull sand offshore; lower, gentle summer waves carry sand onto the beach. Sand flows into submarine canyons where it is stays
