## Natural Zeolite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Natural zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate frameworks with pores occupied by water, alkali, and alkaline earthmetal cations. Due to their unique 3D porous structure, these materials can acquire exceptional adsorption properties. Zeolite generally acts as a good cation exchanger as a result of its negatively charged surface.

Zeolite is one of the rare minerals that possess a natural negative charge. The combination of the honeycomb structure and net negative charge allows Zeolite to both absorb liquids and adsorb elements based on the strength of the chemical bond. The magnetic attraction an element has to Zeolite is called the CEC value or ability to ionexchange
