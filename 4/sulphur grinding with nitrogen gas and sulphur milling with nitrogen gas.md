## Elemental Analysis for Carbon/Sulfur & Oxygen/Nitrogen/Hydrogen Horiba
HORIBA uses the acronym EMIA, which stands for Element Material Infrared Analyzer. O/N/H analyzers refers to products that measure Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Hydrogen in inorganic materials. Depending on the model, 1, 2 or 3 gases are measured. Alternative denomination is also Elemental Analyzers. ISO standards describe the principle as Inert Gas

## Sulfur Information Pipe Ranger Pacific Gas and Electric Company
Sulfur Information. Much of the sulfur contained in the gas delivered by PG&E consists of compounds that naturally occur in the gas, but PG&E also adds sulfur compounds to odorize the gas. The gas is odorized as a safety measure so that leaks can be detected by consumers. Common sulfur compounds that may be found in the gas supply are

## Preparation and photocatalytic activity of visible lightactive sulfur 
Nitrogen and sulfur codoped SrTiO 3 was prepared by high energy grinding of the mixture of SrTiO 3 and thiourea. A new band gap in visible light region (522 nm) corresponding to 2.37 eV could be formed by the codoping.The photocatalytic activity for nitrogen monoxide oxidation of SrTiO 3 in visible light region especially in the long wavelength range (λ > 510 nm) could be improved greatly.
