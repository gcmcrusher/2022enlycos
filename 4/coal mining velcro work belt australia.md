Coal occurs as layers or seams, ranging in thickness from millimetres to many tens of metres. It is composed mostly of carbon (50–98 per cent), hydrogen (3–13 per cent) and oxygen, and smaller amounts of nitrogen, sulphur and other elements. It also contains water and particles of other inorganic matter. When burnt, coal releases energy as

Mining. In Australia, nearly 80% of coal is produced from opencut mines, in contrast to the rest of the world where opencut mining only accounts for 40% of coal production. Opencut mining is possible because coal seams are close to the surface. Such mining is cheaper than underground mining and enables up to 90% recovery of the resource.
