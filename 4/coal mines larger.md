## The number of producing U.S. coal mines fell in 2020
Coal production in the Western region primarily comes from large surface mines in the Powder River Basin. Since 2008, the number of coal mines in the Western region has declined from 58 mines to 45 mines—only 1 of those 13 closures was in the Powder River Basin. So far in 2021, U.S. coal production has increased from 2020 levels.
