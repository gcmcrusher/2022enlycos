## Iron and Manganese Removal MRWA
Most iron removal filters are designed so that the filters are backwashed based on headloss on the filter. If iron breakthrough is a problem, the filters will have to be backwashed more The normallyused filter media (sand) will remove iron and manganese if the combined concentration is below 1 ppm. Higher concentrations require different

## Iron & Manganese Removal Systems Hungerford & Terry
The GreensandPlus Filter. H&T developed and patented the continuous regeneration process for iron and manganese removal in 1963. This process used a feed of chlorine and potassium permanganate upstream of a manganese greensand filter to keep the catalytic manganese dioxide coating of the manganese greensand media regenerated.

## Soluble manganese removal by porous media filtration PubMed
Soluble manganese removal by the MOCS column was rapid and efficient; most of the removal happened at the top (e.g. 5 cm) of the filter. When filter influent with an average manganese concentration of 0.204 mg l (1) was fed through the filter columns, the sand MOCS and MOCS columns removed 98.9% and 99.2% of manganese, respectively.
