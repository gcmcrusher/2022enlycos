Silver Ore Processing Plant. All silver ores need to be fluxed for smelting.6 In Pliny's day, when almost all the ore smelted was highgrade, the addition of lead or lead ore was sufficient for fluxing. By the time that Biringuccio and Agricola are writing in the 16th century, the art of fluxing has advanced in complexity but not in clarity.
