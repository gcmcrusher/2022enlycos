## Tackling emissions World Coal Association
Technologies are now available to tackle the environmental challenges associated with the use of coal. CCUS and HELE reduce CO2 emissions, but technologies are also available to reduce the release of pollutants. Several technologies are often available to mitigate any given environmental impact and reduce emissions.
