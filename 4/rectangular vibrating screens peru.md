## Getting the Best Performance From Vibrating Screen Machines
The vibrating action of the screening machine separates the particles, discharging the smaller unwanted materials through "holes" of specified shape and diameter in the screen and retaining the larger particles for further processing. The screens are round or rectangular and are attached to a frame within an assembly, called a screen deck.

## Rectangular Separator Applications VibraScreener
Rectangular vibrating screeners are used to quickly sort and separate high volumes of wet or dry materials. Generally speaking, they are durable and economical. Several configurations, including linear and sloped designs, make them capable of sorting particles as small as size 20 mesh (0.033") or as large as 1/2″.
