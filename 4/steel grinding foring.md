The act of grinding can be deceivingly simple. But the devil's in the details. Effective grinding requires operators to apply enough pressure at the correct angle to let the grains—the "cutting tool" of a grinding disc—remove the most metal in the shortest time, while not prematurely wearing the disc or burning out the grinding tool.
