Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

## Gold Flotation Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
GOLD FLOTATION. The flotation process, which is today so extensively used for the concentration of basemetal sulphide ores and is finding increased use in many other fields. In 1932 flotation plants began to be installed for the treatment of gold and silver ores as a substitute for or in conjunction with cyanidation.

## Geometallurgical Characterization and Automated Mineralogy of Gold Ores 
For refractory gold ores, in which gold occurs mainly as submicroscopic gold in sulfide minerals and is associated with carbonaceous matter in some deposits, pretreatment is required before leaching, making gold ore processing more challenging and ore characterization more important. 3.1. Classification of Gold Ores and Minerals3.1.1. Gold Ore
