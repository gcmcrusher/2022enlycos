## What is frac sand? American Geosciences Institute
Frac sand is a type of sand with small, uniform particles. It is injected into the rock formation along with the water used to fracture the rock in the process known as hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"). The sand is used to prop open the fractures that are created. Because the particles are uniform, fluids like water, oil, and gas are able to flow through the spaces between the particles.

In 2015, 75 percent of frac sand used in domestic production was shipped by truck or rail from mines located in the upper Midwest – it's often termed "Northern Sand". For Permian producers, that meant managing a 1,200mile supply chain. By 2019, Northern Sand's hold on market share is expected to drop to 38 percent.
