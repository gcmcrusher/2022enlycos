When a long ball screw rotates at high speed it can begin to vibrate once the slenderness ratio reaches the natural harmonics for that shaft size. This is called the critical speed and can be very detrimental to the life of a ball screw. The safe operating speed should not exceed 80% of the critical speed for the screw.

Ball nosed cutters: slow nose speed. The biggest challenge with ball nosed end mills of various kinds is slow nose speed. As you get closer to the tip, the diameter on the ball gets smaller and smaller, finally going to zero. As a result, the cutter must perform over a wide range of surface speeds and chip loads at different depths in the cut.

What is critical speed in a mill? Critical speed is the speed at which unwanted vibration happens when a vessel is rotating. The crushing of particles in a traditional mill is generally accomplished by rotating the mill near the critical speed. Running a mixer in excess of the critical speed can cause destructive mechanical vibrations.
