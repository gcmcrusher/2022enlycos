Grinding Pressure. Users should also consider the grinding pressure, or force per grain. The higher the pressure, the more severe the operation, and the better ceramic and superabrasive grains are likely to perform. The horsepower of the grinding machine can play a role in determining the grade of the bond or the hardness of the wheel.

Pressure controls the velocity of the fluid; the flow rate and temperature control the rate of heat transfer into the fluid. The direction of the flow allows the fluid to remove the airbarrier that travels with the wheel. Many researchers have studied the role of grinding fluids in preventing thermal damage to the workpiece over the past 30 years.
