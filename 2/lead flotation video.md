## Froth Flotation Process Detailed Explanation With Diagrams and Videos
Such ores containing multiple metals such as lead, copper and zinc can be selectively extracted by using froth floatation. The minerals that do not float into the froth are called the flotation tailings or flotation tails. The froth flotation process was first patented by H. F. K. Pickard, E. L.Sulman and John Ballot in the year 1906.

As we look to the future, the mining industry faces a myriad of challenges. While demand for metals like copper, cobalt, lithium and iron ore is projected to reach record highs by 2050, ore grades are decreasing, orebodies are becoming more complex, and fewer tier 1 deposits are being discovered. As metal prices increase, lowergrade orebodies

Cerussite is the major lead oxide. Generally after the vulcanization of Na2S, the flotation is carried out with advanced xanthate as collector. The suitable pH of vulcanization is about 9.5. If the pH is over high because of the large usage of Na2S, the NaHS can be used as the vlucanizing agent. Cerussite can be easily floated by fatty acid.

Most ores contain less than 10% lead, and ores containing as little as 3% lead can be economically exploited. Ores are crushed and concentrated by froth flotation typically to 70% or more. Sulfide ores are roasted, producing primarily lead oxide and a mixture of sulfates and silicates of lead and other metals contained in the ore.

Some of the metals that can do the job are copper and lead. At a pH between 89 lead can activate sphalerite to cause it flotation. So the reason is during the flotation of the two there may be lead re dissolution from galena which may activate sphalerite to cause it flotation. It may best if you are doing bulk flotation of the two.
