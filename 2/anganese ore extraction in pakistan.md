## Manganese Mining and Extraction Manganese Mining Processing
A more progresive extraction of manganese involves directly reducing manganese ore into a heap leach. In this a natural gas is allowed to go through the bottom of the heap. The gas provides the heat and the reducing agent carbon monoxide. The leachable form is then sent through the grinding circuit and to reduce the particle size of the manganese.
