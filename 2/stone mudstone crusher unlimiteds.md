stone/mudstone are 22.2 ms, 3.4 ms and 0.29 ms, respectively. Clear separation of reservoir sandstone, nonreservoir sandstone and siltstone is also seen based on pressure dependency of ultrasonic compressional and shear velocities during initial pressure loading. Reservoir sandstone demonstrates the highest compressibility.
