The cyanide leaching process is the most important method ever developed for extracting gold from its ores. The early development of the process is attributed to a Scotchman, John Stewart Mac Arthur, in collaboration with the Forrest brothers. The method was introduced into South Africa in 1890.

1. Introduction. Gold is a noble metal which shows relative inertia to most chemical reactions (Fu et al., 2018, Gasparrini, 1983, Ilankoon et al., 2018).The majority of gold is extracted from gold ores by cyanide (NaCN) leaching (Aylmore, 2016, Haque, 1987, Liu et al., 2017, Wu et al., 2016) of which heap leaching has been shown to be a very utilitarian and inexpensive method for processing

The following gold leaching test procedure has been found satisfactory for carrying out cyanide leaching tests by agitation. Winchester bottles of about 2.5 to 4liter capacity are used. It is convenient to number the bottles and determine their tares, etching the figures on the bottle by means of hydrofluoric acid and then marking over the etching with a china or glass marking pencil.

Based on the results of gold extraction at different temperature (Fig. 5a), the leaching kinetics of gold ore in coppercitratethiosulfate solutions is a parabolic leaching process. Considering the fact that the change in agitation speed does not significantly affect the leaching kinetics ( Fig. 4 ), it is reasonable to assume that the product

In leaching, ore which has been ground to pulp is placed in agitated tanks with sodium cyanide solution and gold and silver is dissolved into the slurry solution. The leach may require 24 to 72 hours to complete, and after the leach is completed, the leached slurry is routed to the CIP circuit.

Abstract. A dilute cyanide solution is an efficient solvent of gold. However, as in any other leaching process, the solvent has to come in contact with the solid gold particle. Hence, extensive crushing and meticulous twostage, closedcircuit grinding are needed to liberate the gold particles in the ore. Multistage agitation leaching followed
