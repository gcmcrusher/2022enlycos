1. Large Mining Trucks. To move materials around a mine site, workers need heavyduty trucks. Also known as offhighway trucks, large mining trucks include both powerful mechanical models and environmentally friendly electric drive models.. Unlike conventional trucks, these mining vehicles have extralarge tires to support the heavy loads over uneven terrain commonly found around surface mines.
