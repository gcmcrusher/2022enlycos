## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into ironmaking blast furnaces.

Screening: The first one is screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage.; Crushing and stockpiling: This step involves breaking up the iron ore to obtain an F80 grind size before it can be ground. Once the ore is crushed, it is diverted to a stockpile and then fed into the mill; Grinding: The primary grinding mill grinds the material

Processed Iron Ore increases campaign life. Fine particles and Alumina in the feed end up as accretions in the kiln walls. Lower Alumina in the feed means a considerable reduction in cleaning and maintenance of the kilns. CDE Wet Screening technology also ensures lesser dust accumulation in the dust cleaning system reducing its cost implications.

The reason why the pH value of the pulp, the temperature of the pulp and the stirring speed affect the leaching of gold ore is that cyanide easily reacts in the pulp to generate hydrocyanic acid (HCN), which is volatile and toxic. If the hydrocyanic acid volatilizes from the pulp It will cause the loss of cyanide and cause environmental pollution.

The treatment plants at Serra Leste (in Curionópolis) and the S11D complex (in Canaã dos Carajás) do not use water to treat the ore. At the S11D complex, for example, the use of the natural moisture processing route allows water consumption to be reduced by 93% when compared with the conventional method of iron ore production.
