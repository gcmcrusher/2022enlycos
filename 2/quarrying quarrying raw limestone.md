Limestone quarrying began in the early 1800's and continues today. Small amounts of impure limestone have been quarried in many parts of the state, but the only place that has produced a significant amount of lime is the RocklandThomaston area. The "limestone" there is a metamorphosed coarsegrained marble, some of which is quite pure.
