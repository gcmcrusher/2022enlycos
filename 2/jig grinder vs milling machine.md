level 1. · 5 yr. ago. Jig borers are different from a typical knee mill in two important ways: finethread leadscrews with finely divided handwheels and reducing gears or highresolution position encoders. This allows them to work down to divisions that a typical mill can't resolve, and thus they can position very accurately.

## Jig Grinding On A Machining Center Modern Machine Shop
The KSK 1000 is available in two sizes capable of grinding a maximum bore diameter of 150 mm (6 inches) and a depth of 120 mm (5 inches). Additional models can grind diameters up to 310 mm (12 inches). A set of planetary gears in the grinding head runs off the machining center spindle and is used to produce the orbital motion needed to jig bore.
