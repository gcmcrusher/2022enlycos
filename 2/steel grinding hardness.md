## Correct grinding wheel material for hardened steel?
Blue wheels are harder and are good for sharpening drill bits and lathe tools. Grey wheels are softer, and work fine. Waterstone wheels are made of synthetic waterstone material and are fairly soft but excel for sharpening knife blades. The two biggest things are: A good water film on the wheel. The water should be clean and nonacidic.
