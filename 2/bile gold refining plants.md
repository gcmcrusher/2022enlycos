## Balestri Technologies Gold alloys inquartation
Inquartation is a prerefining technique used on alloys with a high silver content (>10%) that cannot be directly treated with Aqua Regia. With this technique the starting material is melted with silver and copper to produce an alloy of 25% gold (corresponding to ¼ of the total, hence the term inquartation) then treated with Aqua Regia (nitric acid (HNO 3) and the metals purified.
