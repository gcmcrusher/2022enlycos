## Separation Efficiency Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
The Separation Efficiency meets all the usual requirements of a true efficiency and is independent of the nature of the process used. It can be visualized as the percentage of the feed material that, in effect, actually undergoes complete separation while the rest of the feed is distributed randomly and unchanged into the two separation products.

Flotation is a mineral separation process done in the water medium. It is based on the difference in the surface properties of the mineral and gangue. The surface of the selected mineral is made hydrophobic (water repellent) by the use of selective reagents and these particles get attached to the air bubbles that are introduced in the system and collected as froth whereas the hydrophilic
