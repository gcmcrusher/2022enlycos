## Design Method of Ball Mill by Sumitomo Chemical Discrete 
The physical constants used in these calculations are given in Table 1. In a discrete element method simulation of the inside of a ball mill, the coefficient of friction of the balls is the most important factor, and it has been reported that the spring coefficient and damping coefficient calculated from Young's modulus and Pois
