## Fineness an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The fineness of the milling product and the capacity of the pulverizer are strictly connected. With increased fineness grows the overall circulation rate of coal in the mill, coal retention time and the flow resistance. As a result, the maximum mill capacity decreases and the rate of change of operational parameters of the furnace system deteriorates.

to a desired degree of fineness. Size distribution of the coal charged to the coke ovens has a significant effect on the quality of the coke produced as both the oversize and undersize particles are detrimental to coke quality. Thus, control of the coal crushing operation is a task of considerable importance. In India, generally hammer mills
