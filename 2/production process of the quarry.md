Quarry. Pozzato Quarry is located 27 km from Banja Luka, on Banja Luka – Prnjavor Trunk Road. The process of production of broken eruptive stone starts with its detection, through transport to crushing and sorting plant, grinding and sorting by fractions of 031 mm, and up to 60 mm if necessary. The capacity of production of diabase is 80 m3/h.

quarry, place where dimension stone or aggregate (sand, gravel, crushed rock) is mined. The products of dimension stone quarries are prismatic blocks of rock such as marble, granite, limestone, sandstone, and slate. After cutting and polishing, these materials are used in the primary construction of buildings and monuments and also for decorative facing materials applied to the exterior and

STEP 4: Stone Splitting. Slabs of stone are brought into the manufacturing facility (aka the cut shop) to be cut by the splitter. The splitter is a large hydraulic press that breaks the stone sheets into pieces of the desired sizes and shapes. (While we're talking shop: this process is also sometimes called snapping, chopping, or machine cutting.)

The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

The process begins with a detailed threedimensional survey of the quarry face. This allows the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled so that the blast can be carried out safely and efficiently. The survey will show if there are any bulges or hollows in the face.

Macleod Construction in the UK is growing its business operations and is investing its two quarries. To maximise production from the quarries, and to produce aggregate for construction projects, the firm needed to source a tracked crusher. The crusher had to be highly productive, tough and versatile and also reliable due to the site's remote location.
