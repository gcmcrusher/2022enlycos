1.working principle of mechanical stirring flotation machine. Mechanical stirring flotation machines are mostly impeller type, which is composed of several flotation tanks. Each unit is equipped with suction tank (with feeding pipe) and direct flow tank (without feeding pipe). The main working part of the flotation machine is the agitator.

## Flotation Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The FLOTATION PROCESS is one of the commonest methods of extracting the valuable minerals from certain classes of ores, and it is generally more efficient as regards the recovery of the minerals than any other process applicable to the treatment of similar types of ores. The metallic contents of the minerals are recovered from the concentrates in a subsequent series of metallurgical operations

This lack of seal can allow the floatation foam to absorb water. It also can rot decks, stringers, frames, bulkheads and transoms. So, a boat uncovered in the rain or docked does not automatically have saturated foam. If there is some damage to the hull or deck, water can enter the foamed space and cause problems.
