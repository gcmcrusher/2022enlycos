## Static Grizzly Screen as a Rock Separator Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Vibrating Grizzly Screen. A vibrating grizzly screen has been developed as a distinct improvement over the fixed grizzly now in such wide use. It combines the functions of screening and feeding the ore to the primary crusher, and, by eliminating the undersize product in the ore feed to the crusher, materially increases the crusher capacity.

2,616 Posts. #5 · Sep 15, 2006. If the screen not only shakes, but the colors distort, then the cause is electromagnetic in nature. Such as a printer or speaker ac power supply or transformer for instance. If none of those is close to the monitor, then it may be an internal falure of the monitor causing the problem.
