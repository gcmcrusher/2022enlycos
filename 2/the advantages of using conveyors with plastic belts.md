## The Gains of Going Low Tension or Tensionless Intralox
Until Intralox introduced modular plastic belting in 1971, all conveyor belts were tensioned and relied on friction. Modular plastic belting was invented to address the inherent problems of metal belts. ThermoDrive belting was created to take food safety to a new level without sacrificing operational reliability.
