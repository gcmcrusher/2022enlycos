Visser: I've found that many new operators don't know the differences between materials, be they aluminum, steel, stainless steel, or anything else. One grade of metal will roll far differently from another. For instance, aluminums can vary in strength from T0 to T6. The aluminum 50 series can be a T0 (very soft) while a 60 series can be at least a T3, and sometimes even a T6.
