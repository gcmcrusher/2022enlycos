CaCo3 cement, which may be fine grained (called micrite) or coarse grained (called sparite), holds the fossils (such as coccoliths and foraminifera) together to form a limestone. Steel making requires large amounts of limestone as raw material, which is projected to drive the limestone market in the region during the forecast period. This
