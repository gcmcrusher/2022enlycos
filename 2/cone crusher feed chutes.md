A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

Feed Opening. Looking at the cone crusher diagram above, the feed opening is the first aspect of the machine. The feed opening is where the raw material feeds into the crusher. Even the largest cone crushers are limited by the size of their feed opening, as they can only accommodate pieces of rock or substrate that will fit inside the machine.
