The final mining was completed on 25 June 2012 after mining to a depth of 1.2km below the surface. For the quarter ending in June, 10,823oz of gold was produced at an operating cost of $786 per ounce. Complete mine closure and rehabilitation is expected by July 2013. The Tasmanian reef was discovered in 1847.

Before the new tailings pond construction completed in 2002, there are 90000 tons of tailings with recoverable tailing with high gold content in the old tailings pond. The gold content is about 1665 kg, and the silver content about 25 tons. Xinhai carried out industrial practice in handling tailings with the original 250tpd CIP plant.

Mine dewatering is the process of eradicating underground water from mines. When a mine extends beneath the water table, underground water is sure to permeate the mine due to gravity. For some developments, groundwater is a secondary issue easy to handle on an impromptu basis. The need for dewatering may be critical in other projects and mines

Mine dewatering is the action of removing groundwater from a mine. When a mine extends below the water table groundwater will, due to gravity, infiltrate the mine workings. On some projects groundwater is a minor impediment that can be dealt with on an adhoc basis.

The foremost benefit of dewatering tailings is the reduction of water that needs to be transported from a process plant to a tailings storage facility (TSF). Reduced water content means tailings slurry volume is decreased, allowing for smaller pipelines and pumping equipment to be used. This can also minimise power requirements.

## What are Tailings Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration
Tailings are a byproduct of mining. After ore containing an economicallyrecoverable commodity is mined from the earth, that commodity is extracted in a processing plant or mill. After the commodity of value is extracted from the ore material, the resultant waste stream is termed "tailings". Typically, mill tailings range from sand to silt
