## Cement Kilns: Design features of rotary kilns
The early commercially successful rotary kilns in Britain were nearly all "straight" cylinders, the exceptions being those at Norman (1904). Lengthening of the early kilns at Wouldham and Bevans resulted in kilns with enlarged burning zones, while the lengthened kilns at Swanscombe had enlargements at both ends. Among new installations from 1909 to 1914, only 15 out of 44 were "straight", the

Rotary and planetary coolers operate under suction and although noisy, produce little atmospheric pollution. The waste air of a grate cooler naturally contains a large amount of gritty clinker dust. The early coolers, like the kilns, made little effort to trap this, and produced a lot of fallout in the immediate vicinity.

Rotary coolers work by tumbling material in a rotating drum in the presence of chilled or ambient air. The drum is set at a slight horizontal slope to allow gravity to assist in moving material through the drum. Lifting flights maximize heat transfer efficiency by lifting up material and dropping it through the chilled air as the drum rotates.
