## Introduction to Conveyor Belt Systems Technical Articles
Belt Conveyor System. A belt conveyor uses a belt to transport material from one point to another. The belt is stretched across the conveyor length with pulleys at both ends to support the belt. A driving mechanism such as an electric motor rotates the pulleys, which moves the belt across the conveyor length.

As shown in the figure below (Figure A), the tension on the belt is accomplished by turning the screw at the end of a conveyor. This pushes the bearing block towards the end of the conveyor, which adds tension to the belt. There is another, identical jackscrew located on the opposite side of the roller.
