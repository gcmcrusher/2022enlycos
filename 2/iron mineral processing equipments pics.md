## Size recovery curves of minerals in industrial spirals for processing 
Mineral size recovery curves in spirals are calculated using data from two iron ore processing plants. • Recovery of iron carrier particles increase up to 0.2 mm and then decreases due to the Bagnold force. • The decrease of recovery for coarse silica carrier particles is more important than that of iron carrier particles.
