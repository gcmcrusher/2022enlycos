Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel. 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel. Minnesota's iron ore was actually discovered while prospectors were searching for gold. Since the object of their search was gold, the iron was ignored. It turned out the iron would become

Most of the taconite used today requires very fine grinding. Prior to grinding, the ore is drycrushed in up to six stages, depending on the hardness of the ore. Because only about 33 percent of the crude taconite becomes a shippable product for iron making, a large amount of gangue is generated. Particulate and SO 2 Compliance Tests on

## 8 Developments in iron ore comminution and  ScienceDirect
Application of Vertimill® fine grinding technology at Hibbing Taconite Company enabled processing of lowergrade ores and increased the concentrate production (Pforr, 2001). The Sino iron project, located in Cape Preston, about 100 km southwest of Karratha in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, will be the world's biggest magnetite iron

## Taconite Wikipedia
Taconite (/ ˈ t æ k ən aɪ t /) is a variety of iron formation, an ironbearing (over 15% iron) sedimentary rock, in which the iron minerals are interlayered with quartz, chert, or carbonate.The name "taconyte" was coined by Horace Vaughn Winchell (1865–1923) – son of Newton Horace Winchell, the Minnesota State Geologist – during their pioneering investigations of the Precambrian

## Physical and Hydrologic Properties of Taconite Tailings
Fine tailings core moisture contents were negatively correlated with tailings particle size. As a result, the fine tailings cores collected nearest to the tailings discharge points collected at eight locations in Hibbing Taconite's tailings basin (Figure 1). The basin is located north of the city of Hibbing, Minnesota in the Mississippi
