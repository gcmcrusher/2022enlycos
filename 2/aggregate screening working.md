The difference between dewatering screen manufacturers is small tweaks to a centuryold design. (1) We're the only manufacturer to include screens on the sidewalls, which exposes the sand to more screening action to remove more moisture. (2) Combined with a higher gforce, our screens allow deeper sand depths to physically squeeze out more water.

The screen box uses shafts with counterweights or exciters to cause the material bed to vibrate. Through the vibration, larger particles work their way to the top of the material bed, while the smaller particles make contact with the screening surface. Because they are inclined, circularmotion screens provide a high travel rate.
