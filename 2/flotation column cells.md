The other type of flotation cells is a column cell. Column cells are tall round tanks that use compressed air to create air bubbles via spargers or cavitation tubes. These cells are used to perform mineral separations. Column cells do not use mechanical agitation (impellers). Mixing is achieved by the turbulence provided by the rising bubbles.
