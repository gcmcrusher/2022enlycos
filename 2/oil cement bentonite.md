The extension efficiency of bentonite can be greatly enhanced if it is prehydrated in the mix water before cement addition. A slurry containing 2% prehydrated bentonite BWOC is equivalent to one containing 8% dryblended bentonite (Table 34). Complete hydration of a goodquality bentonite occurs in about 30 min.
