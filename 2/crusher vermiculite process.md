The term vermiculite applies to a group of minerals characterized by their ability to expand into long, wormlike strands when heated. This expansion process is called exfoliation. The name vermiculite is derived from a combination of the Latin word vermiculare meaning "to breed worms," and the English suffixite, meaning mineral or rock.
