## Perlite Wikipedia
Perlite softens when it reaches temperatures of 850–900 °C (1,560–1,650 °F). Water trapped in the structure of the material vaporises and escapes, and this causes the expansion of the material to 7–16 times its original volume. The expanded material is a brilliant white, due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles.

The expansion process is caused by the presence of water in the crude rock. When perlite ore is rapidly heated to above 850°c this water vaporises and causes the softened rock to expand. Tiny glasslike bubbles are produced which account for the lightweight and exceptional physical properties of expanded perlite.
