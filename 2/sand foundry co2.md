## Sand Cores Using Sodium Silicate and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Blogger
Sand, when mixed with the correct ratio of sodium silicate, rammed into a core box, and then exposed to carbon dioxide (CO 2), will result in a very hard and durable sand core.Never having used sodium silicate (and never having made sand cores before!), this was an excellent lesson in learning what works and what doesn't.
