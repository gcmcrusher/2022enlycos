A mill load is defined as the instantaneous total charge of a ball mill and is composed of a new feed ore, slurry, water, and steel balls inside the mill (Tang et al., 2015a). Overloading causes "mill spitting ore," coarsening on the particle size of mill outlet, "mill blockage," "belly be filled full," and production process break off.

The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid overgrinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

## The working principle of ball mill Meetyou Carbide
22 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically
