In the final stages a detailed bottomup estimation based on first principles may be completed. This paper will investigate common methodologies of estimating operating costs for mines and present examples from actual operations and why those methods were selected. It will highlight why some methods are superior to others.

## Electrolytic Copper Refining Plant Metal Recycling Machines
The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine. In the electrolytic refining of copper, a thin sheet of highpurity Cu serves as the cathode. The blister copper plates are taken and used as anodes in an electrolyte bath of copper sulfate, CuSO4, and sulfuric acid H2SO4.

The matte, about 45 to 55 percent copper and the remainder iron silicate slag, is formed in a very fast, almost instantaneous reaction; hence the name "flash smelting.". The matte sinks through the lighter slag layer and flows down the. inclined crucible. Conversion to copper proceeds in a zone around position two.
