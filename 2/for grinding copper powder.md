When the copper powder obtained by the wet reduction method is kneaded with the resin at a high filling rate, it is difficult to maintain low viscosity. In this invention, the said high viscosity problem is solved without changing the characteristics, such as a particle diameter and specific surface area, of the copper powder obtained by the wet reduction method.
