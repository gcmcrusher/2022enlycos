Coal Pulverizer – Power Plant Pall Corporation. Pulverization of coal is currently the favored method of preparing coal for burning. Mechanically pulverizing coal into a fine powder enables it to be burned like a gas, thus allowing more efficient combustion. Transported by an air or an air/gas mixture, pulverized coal can be introduced

A system for detecting a combustionrelated condition in a pulverizer includes a pulverizer configured to receive coal chunks via an inlet, to grind the coal chunks into coal powder and to output the coal powder via an outlet. The system includes sensors configured to detect heat input characteristics supplied to the pulverizer and heat output characteristics emitted from the pulverizer.

## What are Coal feeders? Principle, components. Instrumentation and 
What are coal feeders? Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill. The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace). The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on the type, namely by weight fraction or coal volume
