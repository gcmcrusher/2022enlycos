The process of chromite ore mining can be divided into 2 areas: 1. Feed preparation. 2. Concentration. The feed preparation stage involves the introduction of various physical separation equipment including crushers, screens, and grinding mills. The principal function of this stage is size reduction in preparation for the concentration phase.

Leaching characteristics of chromium ore processing residue (COPR) for the long term (simulating a 20year leaching scenario) were investigated using laboratory flowthrough column testing with synthetic rainwater and groundwater for 250 pore volumes of flow (PVFs).

## A clean and efficient leaching process for chromite ore
The leaching process was controlled by inner diffusion, and the activation energy was calculated to be 55.6 kJ/mol in the temperature range of 280–370 °C. Download : Download fullsize image; Fig. 10. Arrhenius plot for the leaching process of Philippine chromite ore.

## Leaching of Valuable Elements from the Waste Chromite Ore Processing 
chromite ore processing residue (COPR) is an inevitable solid emission in chromite salt production. It is an industrial waste produced during the extraction of Cr(VI) from a chromite ore using the hightemperature roasting process.11 In general, the COPR is alkaline (pH > 12),5,7 and because of the presence of partially watersoluble

## Chemistry and Leaching Behavior of Chromite Ore Processing Residue from 
Abstract This study presents chemical, mineralogical, and leaching characterization of chromite ore processing residue (COPR) derived from the soda ash process, which is currently replacing the limebased process in China, the world's largest chromite processor. Results indicated that, while soda ash COPR had 8,500 mg/kg Cr(VI), 90% of that was readily available in deionized water and thus the

## Chomite ore processing plants, CDE Asia
Chromite ore is predominantly used in the production of ferrochrome – an alloy of chrome and iron containing between 50% and 70% chromium. The production of steel is the largest consumer of ferrochrome, especially stainless steel production which contains between 10% and 20% ferrochrome content. The process of chromite ore mining can be
