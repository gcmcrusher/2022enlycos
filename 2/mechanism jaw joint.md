## TMJ Specialist Philadelphia Temporomandibular Joint Disorder Treatment
Temporomandibular Joint Disorder or TMJ Syndrome, is an umbrella term covering a variety of conditions associated with the inflammation of the Temporomandibular Joint, which connects the lower jaw to the skull. Dysfunction of this joint can cause significant pain and damage. Assisting patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) is one

## TMJ Basics The TMJ Association
TMJ stands for Temporomandibular Joint, or jaw joint. The TMJs are the two joints in front of each ear. The joints connect the lower jaw bone (the mandible) to the temporal bones of the skull on each side of the head. The muscles controlling the joints are attached to the mandible and allow the jaw to move in three directions: up and down, side

Functional jaw movements of chewing, swallowing, and speech involve relatively short durations of tooth contacts. However, parafunctional clenching commonly occurs while awake (awake bruxism) and appears to be driven by psychosocial factors generating daytime stress and mood changes (Glaros et al. 2005, Manfredini & Lobbezoo 2010).Episodic daytime clenching is of longer duration than sleep

Lower jaw is too far forward. A lower jaw that is too far forward (prognathia) causes the chin to protrude. Lower teeth may jut outward to overlap the upper teeth. Teeth don't meet (open bite). An open bite is often due to a long upper jaw. This can cause a "gummy smile." Or the problem may be that the rear of the lower jaw is too short.
