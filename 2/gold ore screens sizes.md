A 4mesh screen means there are four little square openings across one inch of screen. A 100mesh screen has 100 openings per inch, and so on. As the number indicating the mesh size increases, the size of the openings and thus the size of particles captured by the screen decreases. Higher mesh numbers = smaller particle sizes. It is very

Crushing the ore can free the gold and allow recovery by gravitybased methods. In fact it's very common that the gold in hard rock ores will range in the 30 to 200mesh size range with most of the gold in the lower end of that range. The tried and true method for testing these ores in the field is hand crushing and panning.

For example, a 36 mesh screen will have 36 openings while a 150 mesh screen will have 150 openings. Since the size of screen (one square inch) is constant, the higher the mesh number the smaller the screen opening and the smaller the particle that will pass through. Generally US Mesh is measured using screens down to a 325 mesh (325 openings in
