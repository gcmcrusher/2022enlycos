Explanation on reverse: In auriferious districts where water is scarce or absent, the prospector tests the value of his 'find' by dry blowing. The goldbearing sand is poured from one dish to another in the open air. The breeze blows aside the lighter particles, leaving the gold and coarser sand to fall into the lower dish, when the gold can be 'specked' from the sand.
