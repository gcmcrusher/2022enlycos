## Types of Screw Conveyors
Incline Screw Feeder. Incline screw feeder is a screw conveyor on an incline above 10deg and up to 45deg. Like with an inclined screw conveyor, the efficiency of the flighting decreases as the incline increases. The required variable pitch to meter the bulk material only compounds the problems in an incline screw feeder because different pitches have different efficiencies as the angle increase.
