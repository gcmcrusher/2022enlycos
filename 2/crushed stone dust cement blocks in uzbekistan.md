## Is exposure to airborne concrete, stone, brick, or granite dust 
When materials such as concrete, stone, brick, or granite are cut or ground by workers, it can create extremely fine dust particles, which can make their way deep into the lungs if inhaled. These silica dust particles can cause scarring in the lungs, leading to a serious and irreversible lung condition known as silicosis.

For M20 grade and w/c 0.5, conventional concrete workability is found to be 0.95. For 20% quarry dust workability is 0.94. Further workability is decreased to 0.93 for 30% replaced concrete. For 40% quarry dust concrete workability is 0.90 and for 50% replacement of quarry dust concrete 0.89 compacting factor was observed.
