The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and directsmelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.

Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.
