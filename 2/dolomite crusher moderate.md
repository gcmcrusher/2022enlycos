Dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2 is an ordered rhombohedral carbonate, with alternating layers of Mg and Ca ions lying parallel to the basal plane, interleaved with layers of CO 3 groups in which the groups are oriented differently in adjacent planes. Since dolomite has an ordered structure, Barber and Wenk (2001) suggest that perfect dislocations should be called superdislocations.
