## Coal Mill Control and Optimization Using a Multilayer Structure
Abstract: Ball mill coal pulverizing system is a multipleinput multipleoutput (MIMO) process characterized with strong couplings and nonlinearities. Conventional control methods maybe work well initially, but will deviate from optimal work point for a period of time and even cease to be functionally effective.
