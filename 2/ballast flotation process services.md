## What is Ballast Water? Ballast Tanks and Ship Ballast
Ballast water is the sea water taken into the ballast tanks of the ship to maintain ship's stability. Larger the size of the ship, greater the stability it requires, and more number of ballast tanks it possess. Ballast water intake and discharge is generally done at the ports before the loading and unloading of cargo. The process of ballasting thus not only provides stability to the ship

Ballast – In many cases, placing water (or the liquid that will be stored in the tank) during the construction phase will provide ballast for the tank and assist with preventing floatation.

In summary, traction is the friction generated between the tire and the road or field surface. Flotation is the ability of a tire to stay on the surface of soft ground, soil, or snow without rutting or digging into the surface or ground thus limiting the tire from overcoming the friction or providing traction.

## What Is a Ballast on a Boat? (For Stable Floatation & Easy Boating)
Boarding a stable vessel that strides over tides without the risk of capsizing is possible because of a boat's ballast. The "ballast" of a boat provides stability while lowering gravitational balance and reducing the roll. This can be a "ballast tank or bag" containing water or other counterweights to increase boat displacement.
