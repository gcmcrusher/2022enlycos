Bentonite surface is anionic and its edges have cationic charge density. Anionic edge bentonites are used in the grinding of crumbs or powder fibers. The high amounts of both soluble and nonsoluble anionic contaminants in chemical, mechanical and waste paper pulps cause difficulties in neutralizing the wet end of paper production with coagulants.
