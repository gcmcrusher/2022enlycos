JAW CRUSHER. Jaw crushers reduce large rocks or ore by means of compression. Mechanical pressure is applied using the crusher's two jaw; one is fixed while the other makes an eccentric movement. There are also primary and secondary types of these crushers. Jaw crushers are one of the most commonly preferred crushers due to their ability to

The Crusher throw is defined as the distance in the direction of compression the moving crushing surfaces/plates travel from OSS to CSS. Throw = OSS – CSS. OSS and CSS will define a crusher's performance. The throw of the crusher is the distance that moving jaw moves in going from OSS to CSS. The capacity is a function of size and OSS.

## Crusher Wikipedia
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
