belt. Uniform measurement is critical because for ore sorting to have most value, material should not be blended prior to the ore sorting point. This means that high grade copper has an equal probability of being located anywhere on the belt. If only the center and/or the surface of the material is measured accurately, there is a high likelihood

## Research on Image Multifeature Extraction of Ore Belt and RealTime 
Considering the complexity of the actual surface imaging of the ore belt of Shaking Table Concentrator, the detection of the ore belt can be interfered by the fluctuation in the lighting environment of the beneficiation plant affect. As a result, the detection and extraction of the wrong geometric feature values of the ore belt can be caused by
