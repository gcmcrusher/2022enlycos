## OSHA Silica Rule Misconception of Glass Dust TERRAZZCO
To best understand silica, we must address where it comes from and how it is formed. Silica makes up most of the Earth's crust. 100 times smaller than sand, silica is not visible to the naked eye. Today silica is found in many building materials, with dust forming by cutting, grinding, or drilling these materials on the construction site.
