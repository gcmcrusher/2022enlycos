## Strategies for enhancing the contribution of the Gemstone Mining Sector 
In Zambia's mining context, most of the gemstones are exploited by artisanal and smallscale mining players. Therefore, erecting strategies that aim at growing the subsector needs to be undertaken through the lens of these miners. There is still an international definitional confusion of what constitutes artisanal and smallscale mining.
