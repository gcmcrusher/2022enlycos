## What Direction Do Guitar String Vibrations Go? – Mozart Project
What Type Of Vibration Is A Guitar String? It is produced by vibrating objects as they move. As the guitar string vibrates, it generates vibrations in the surrounding air molecules. At the same frequency, these air molecules vibrate when vibrating along with the vibrating frequencies of the guitar strings.

A mode of vibration is a characteristic pattern or shape in which a mechanical system will vibrate. Most systems have many modes of vibration, and it is the task of modal analysis to determine these mode shapes. The actual vibration of a structure is always a combination or mixture of all the vibration modes.
