3. Test the hardness by filing the metal. Use a metal file to perform a file test. Lay the metal on a flat surface and rub the file against 1 end. Steel is a relatively hard metal, so filing off fragments should take some work. Depending on the file's hardness, you may not even be able to wear off any of the metal this way.

## High Manganese Wear Resistant Steel Castings ASTM A128M ZGMn131 Matreial
High strength alloys often contain 1 to 1.8% manganese. At about 1.5% manganese content, the steel becomes brittle, and this trait increases until about 4 to 5% manganese content is reached. At this point, the steel will pulverize at the strike of a hammer. Further increase in the manganese content will increase both hardness and ductility.

## What are the Different Grades of Steel? Mead Metals, Inc.
Carbon Steel has three main subgroups depending on how much carbon is in the metal: Low Carbon Steels/Mild Steels (up to 0.3% carbon), Medium Carbon Steels (0.3–0.6% carbon), and High Carbon Steels (more than 0.6% carbon). Companies often manufacture these steels in massive quantities since they're cheap to manufacture and they're strong
