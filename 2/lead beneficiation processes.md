Sulfur makes up a substantial portion of the mineral in the lead ore galena which is called lead sulfide. The flotation process helps in bringing out the sulfurbearing portions of the ore, since it also contains the valuable metal. The finely crushed ore is diluted with water and then poured into a tank. The mixture of water and ground ore

lead processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Lead (Pb) is one of the oldest metals known, being one of seven metals used in the ancient world (the others are gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and mercury). Its low melting point of 327 °C (621 °F), coupled with its easy castability and softness and malleability, make lead and lead alloys especially suitable for a wide
