## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of singlesize aggregate products – up to 40 mm in size.

## Control ventilation of dry ball mill to improve work efficiency
Then we need to know the wind speed inside the control equipment. As for the selection of wind speed in the mill, generally speaking, natural ventilation v0.4m/s and strong ventilation v = 0.7m/s. Some foreign factories believe that the wind speed V of strong ventilation should be 0.5 9 ~ 1.0 m / s. However, it can be seen from figure 3262.
