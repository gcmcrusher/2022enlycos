The resistivity meter is a device that acts as both a voltmeter (measuring V) and an ammeter (measuring I) and records resistance values (V/I). These resistance values are converted to apparent resistivity values using the formula: where ρ a = apparent resistivity and k = geometric factor. The geometric factor varies based on the geometry of
