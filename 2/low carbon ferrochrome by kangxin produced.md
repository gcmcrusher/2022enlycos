Ferrochrome is created with iron, chrome, and oxygen. The highgrade chromite ore to be taken from the Ring of Fire area is grinded and put through a processing plant that requires high levels of energy to melt the ore and add carbon to separate the oxygen from the iron and chrome. The completed iron and chrome product is called ferrochrome.

Ferrochrome (FeCr),also known as Ferrochromium, is a ferro alloy with chromium and ferro as its main components. It usually contains 50% to 70% chromium. Mainly used in the steel industry. Low carbon ferro chrome (LC FeCr) is produced by reducing chrome ore with Ferro Silicon Chromium. Usually the chromium content is at least 60%.
