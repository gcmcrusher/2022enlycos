The rotary disc filter cycle as shown in Figure 7.5 is restricted to single cake formation and deliquoring phases (see also Section 1.4.1.6).Due to the vertical orientation of the sectored discs, displacement washing, although technically feasible, is difficult to perform reliably. A typical cycle is initiated by causing the discs to rotate through the trough of suspension where the internally

The purpose of a vacuum filter is "Slurry Filtering" and therefore to remove more of the water from the concentrate, this "Concentrate Filtration" is accomplished by using a vacuum. Again for your understanding of the method you will have to know something about the design of a filtering system and of course the filter itself.

The concentrate (or concentrates) produced in the facility must usually be dewatered prior to shipment. The first step of the dewatering procedure is usually sedimentation. The design engineer must be extremely careful when developing the size of concentrate thickeners from laboratory data. In the laboratory, concentrates settle extremely rapidly.

With thickness similar to filter paper, this fabric provides higher flow and is more flexible than felt. It's often used to filter water, light oil, and water soluble and synthetic coolants in metal polishing, grinding, and finishing applications.

## Thickening Kadant Fiber Processing
The Kadant Direct Discharge disk filter is optimal for stock thickening and water return/channeling, removing water from pulp slurry. The pulp slurry is fed to the disk filter at approximatively 1% concentration and is accepted at 1012%. The disk filter's main advantage over other dewatering equipment is that it retains most of the fibers.
