## SPE 28815 The Separation of Solids and Liquids with Hydrocyclone Based 
Hydrocyclones operate under pressure. Fluid is directed tangentially into the hydrocyclone which causes it to spin. The spinning motion generates strong centrifugal forces which induces the solid and liquid, or the two immiscible liquids, to separate. The centrifugal force generated in a hydrocyclone varies over its length, and may reach a
