## Chromium Wikipedia
Chromium is a chemical element with the symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is the first element in group 6.It is a steelygrey, lustrous, hard, and brittle transition metal. Chromium metal is valued for its high corrosion resistance and hardness.A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic

## What Are the Physiologic Effects of Chromium Exposure?
A 1983 study of 43 chromeplating plants in Sweden, where workers were exposed almost exclusively to Cr(VI) acid, revealed that all workers with nasal mucosa ulceration or perforation were periodically exposed to at least 20 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) when working near the plating baths (The newest U.S. permissible exposure level in

## Chrome plating Wikipedia
Chrome plating (less commonly chromium plating) is a technique of electroplating a thin layer of chromium onto a metal object. A chromeplated item is called chrome.The chromed layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, or increase surface hardness. Sometimes, a less expensive imitator of chrome may be used for aesthetic purposes.
