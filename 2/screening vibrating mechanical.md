OPERATIONAL THEORY. The Prater Vibratory Screener utilizes a vibrating deck that is attached to one or more screening elements. Each of the screens is used to segregate and capture a specific size fraction of the aggregate particle mixture. Screening efficiency is much greater when a vibratory enhancement is added to the sizing process.
