## Cement manufacturing process: Stepbystep guide
The ball mill grinds the feed to a fine powder in two chambers, namely the first and second chambers. The two chambers have a certain quantity of ball charge of different sizes from 17mm to 90 mm. The mill discharge is fed to a bucket elevator which takes the material to a separator which separates fine and coarse product.

We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media. While the mill is stopped, the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.
