Highpressure oxidation comprises the oxidisation of sulphide/carbonaceous gold ore at high pressure and temperature. Temperatures exceeding 200 °C and oxygen pressures above 2200 kPa are used to attain complete oxidation of the goldbearing ore. Reaction rates can be very fast, and the technology is widelyaccepted.

tin processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Tin (Sn) is a relatively soft and ductile metal with a silvery white colour. It has a density of 7.29 grams per cubic centimetre, a low melting point of 231.88 °C (449.38 °F), and a high boiling point of 2,625 °C (4,757 °F). Tin is allotropic; that is, it takes on more than one form. The normal form is white tin, or beta

The Hunt methodcalls for the direct treatment of the ore with a solution of potassium cyanide to which ammonium hydroxide has been added. The gold is thus extracted together with some copper, and the metals are recovered by electrolytic precipitation, the gold, silver and copper falling to the bottom of the vats as a sludge.

The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.
