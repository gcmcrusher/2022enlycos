## Manganese beneficiation with Rare earth permroll magnetic separators
Within the scope of the new project in Turkiye; highgrade manganese ore was beneficiated with highgrade permroll magnetic separators. With BAS Linear controlled effective vibro feeders, the material is fed with efficiently on the roll belt with maximum capacity. This project summarized with; 10 tph %13Mn grade ore is increased to 40Mn%.
