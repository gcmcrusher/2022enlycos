A material such as sand, plaster or wax is used in expendable mold casting, whereas metal and other durable materials are used in nonexpendable mold casting techniques. The material fills the casting mold model and is allowed to harden, at which point the manufacturer removes it from the cavity and the casting of the component can now begin.
