## Quartz Stone: How Is It Processed and What Is It Good for?
Quartz ore crushing. A jaw crusher is selected for crushing quartz stone to a particle size of about 150 mm. The advantages of the jaw crusher are large throughput and feeding size, simple and convenient maintenance, and low cost. Quartz stone is a material with higher hardness, so the cone crusher is the best choice in the secondstage crushing.
