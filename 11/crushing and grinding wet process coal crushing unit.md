## 25.3 Crushing and milling Mining of mineral resources Siyavula
Coal found in sedimentary rock, is crushed into the appropriate size and used as fuel for electricity generation or the ironmaking process. Lumps of coal can be used directly as a fuel. However some coal is first washed to make it into 'high grade coal'. It can also be sorted into various sizes, depending on what the fuel is required for.

## Difference between Crushing and Grinding
When making comparisons of the efficiencies of different grinding and crushing machines it is desirable to be able to estimate the work actually done in crushing the ore from a given size of feed to a given size of product, the screen analysis of both feed and product being determined.

Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coalfired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%80% of ash and 30%40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.

After ore is fed into the crusher, it remains in the unit and continues to be crushed until it reaches a size small enough to be discharged from the unit. Grinding and pulverizing the ore is performed later in the mineral process to reduce the product down to the smaller size ranges, normally measured in mesh sizes.

Rock crusher. Material is reduced by crushers and grinders by fracturing, which takes place when the material is put under stress by the moving parts of the crushing or grinding equipment. Forces applied during the process may be compressive, shear or impact. The material fractures when the internal strain levels reach a critical level.

Similar to the dry process, materials also need to undergo quarrying, primary crushing, secondary crushing, proportioning and grinding in the raw materials preparation stage of the wet process. The biggest difference between the two methods is that in the wet process, water is usually required as a process media added in the raw mix to form slurry.
