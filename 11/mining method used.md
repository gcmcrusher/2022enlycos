CutandFill Mining. A method of shorthole mining, cutandfill mining is used in irregular or steeply dipping ore zones, especially where the hanging wall limits the use of longheld methods. The ore is mined either in slightly inclined or horizontal slices then it is filled with sand, waste rock, or tailings.

This mining method has been used extensively in the mining industry. Jet Boring. Jet boring involves freezing the ore and surrounding rock in order to mine safely at Cigar Lake. Brine, chilled to 40C, is piped underground to the deposit. The brine is circulated through large pipes, freezing the surrounding rock in about one year.

Insitu mining, also known as insitu leaching or solution mining, is a method used to recover valuable minerals from ores.

Openpit mining. Openpit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an openpit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Openpit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

Caving methods. Caving methods include block caving, sublevel caving, and longwall mining.For emphasis, allow me to repeat what I said earlier: caving methods are used in settings where the ore or the host rock is so weak that it cannot support its own weight for any period of time; the methods only work if the rock or the ore will readily cave under its own weight.
