Cadmium can resist a humid atmosphere better than zinc, but it has a far less protecting power than zinc. The most common method of applying cadmium coating is by electroplating. Cadmium plating is done in cyanide baths containing a mixture of cadmium oxide and sodium cyanide to produce Na 2 Cd(CN) 4. The following is the formation:

Polycrystalline cadmium sulfide (CdS) is reported to be the best heterojunction or ntype partner for the nCdS/pCdTe thin film solar cell. CdS is mainly chosen as a window layer because of its high band gap (Eg = 2.4 eV at room temperature) compared to that of CdTe

The mined zinc ores are crushed and ground by cadmium ore crushers and cadmium mills to liberate the zinc sulfide particles from the waste host rock. The ground ore is usually treated by a differential flotation process to separate the zincbearing particles from the waste rock, yielding a highgrade zinc concentrate and waste tailings.

Cadmium plating is the process of applying a thin layer of cadmium to a metal surface. It is used to protect the metal from corrosion and to provide a sacrificial layer that will corrode before the underlying metal. Cadmium plating is also used to improve the electrical conductivity of the metal and to provide a smooth, wearresistant surface.
