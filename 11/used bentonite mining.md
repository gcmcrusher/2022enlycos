B1 Earthing. Bentonite Clay has been used as a low cost adsorbent to assist with cost effective removal of metals and organic compounds from wastewaters. The calcium bentonite clays have a high capacity to bind metal ions dissolved in solution. This adsorption, the binding of chemicals to clay surfaces, is a rapid process and the binding is strong.
