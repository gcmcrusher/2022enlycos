## Texas Must Not Let Nuclear, Coal Power Take Priority on State's 
It also could discourage investment because the inclusion of an unknown number of nuclear power and "clean" coal plants makes it difficult for the renewable industry to accurately assess transmission capacity in various CREZ zones and on various lines. The idea that nuclear and coal plants could be built in a reasonable amount of time is

## How Much Coal Does It Take To Make A Solar Panel? 2022
To put that into perspective, consider this: it takes about 6 tons of coal to produce 7200kWh, which would be required to power one home for a year using 10 kW of solar panels. Therefore, it takes approximately 1 ton of coal to power the average residential solar system for one year. As the need and demand for solar power increases, so does

## Coal National Geographic Society
Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States. Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient organisms. Because coal takes millions of years to develop and there is a limited amount of it, it is a nonrenewable resource.

The principle of how coal generates electricity is fundamentally the same as in Edison's day, and similar to other thermal power stations like gas : the coal is burned, heating water to create steam, which spins a turbine to produce electricity.

Coal impacts: water pollution. When you burn charcoal in your grill at home, ash is leftover. The same is true for coalfired power plants, which produce more than 100 million tons of coal ash every year. More than half of that waste ends up in ponds, lakes, landfills, and other sites where, over time, it can contaminate waterways and drinking water supplies.
