## Types of Mining Methods Cummins Inc.
Openpit mining. Openpit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an openpit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Openpit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
Surface Mining. Surface mining includes numerous techniques and is the most common method for nonfuel minerals, producing 97% of the amount mined. Miners choose surface extraction for minerals located close to the surface. There are three main ways to mine on the surface. These methods include quarrying, openpit mining, and strip mining.

## The five most expensive metals and where they are mined
Analysis. Palladium is the most expensive of the four major precious metals â€“ gold, silver and platinum being the others. It is rarer than platinum, and is used in larger quantities for catalytic converters. In the nearterm, the demand for metals used in catalytic converters is expected to be steady, buoyed by growing automotive sales in Asia.
