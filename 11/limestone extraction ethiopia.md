## New Miner Development center aims to maximize natural resources 
Following the establishment of the center, Engineer Takele Uma, Minister of Mines and Petroleum said Ethiopia has significant natural resources in all parts of the country. However, a few of these resources has been identified and "the remaining is still waiting for us to discover," he tweeted.

Of all of Ethiopia's mineral potential, potash has garnered some of the greatest interest. 95% of the world's potash is mined for use in fertilizers, while the rest is used for feed supplements and industrial production. As can be seen in the map below, potash deposits can be found scattered around Ethiopia's northern, central and southern regions.

Towards reaping the benefits. The government has long since realised the importance of lime for farmers and its potential impact on the Ethiopian economy. It has allocated funding and resources to improve access to lime by establishing a supply chain. More needs to be done however, in order to supply lime to all smallholders in this country.

Year defined. 1868. Antalo Limestone (Ethiopia) The Antalo Limestone, also known as the Antalo Sequence, is a geological formation in Ethiopia. It is between 300 and 800 metres thick and comprises fossiliferous limestones and marls that were deposited in a reef. Marine microfossils have shown an age between 165 and 150 million years.

Lime is a calciumcontaining inorganic material composed primarily of oxides, and hydroxide, usually calcium oxide and/or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coalseam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The International Mineralogical Association recognizes lime as a mineral with the chemical formula of CaO.
