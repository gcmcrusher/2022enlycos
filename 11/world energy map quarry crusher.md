## 4.E.1 NonMetallic Minerals – Concrete and Crushed Rock
At a quarry, typically, jaw crusher produces fragments of many different sizes. So the quarry operator will typically use screens and conveyor belts to separate the different size fractions, because different size fractions are used for different purposes. Some crushed rock is mixed with tar, and that produces asphalt. [MUSIC]

Crushed stone is an angular form of construction aggregate, made by breaking quarried rock into fragments that may be sorted, sized, and recombined into a variety of products. Crushed stone is typically quarried—that is, mined using benching methods (carrying out work from a ledge in a mine or quarry) and explosives, as opposed to the mechanical digging used for extracting sand and gravel
