Mill Type Overview. Three types of mill design are common. The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 – 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 – 250 microns.; The CenterPeriphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product discharges
