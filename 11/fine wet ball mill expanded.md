The ceramic ball mill uses a ceramic material liner, and ceramic alumina balls are used as grinding media. It is the key ball grinding mill equipment for fine grinding after the ceramic glaze is coarse grinding. The ceramic ball mill machine is widely used for the dry or wet grinding of the ceramic glaze mineral raw materials, such as feldspar, quartz, talc, kaolin, etc.

Grinding was carried out in the laboratory ball mill described in Table 1, at a low ball load of 20% of the mill volume filled with the ball bed and a low powder load corresponding to a formal interstitial filling of void spaces of the ball bed of U=0.5. These conditions were chosen since it is known that they give first order grinding kinetics for normal grinding, both dry and wet.

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid overgrinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.
