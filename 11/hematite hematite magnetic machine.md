## Magnetic Hematite Vs. Hematite Mineralogy Geology eHow
Hematite Mineralogy Geology. Polished mineral hematite and magnetic hematite are visually very similar. It is easy to confuse the mineral hematite with the manmade material that goes by the name "magnetic hematite." In certain forms, both share a very similar silvery appearance. In addition, both are often confused with the mineral magnetite.

April 28, 2022. Scientifically, Hematite is antiferromagnetic below Morin transition temperature. It acts as ferromagnetic above 948K temperature. However, in general terms, It is not magnetic. As we know, iron ore has had significant uses for a long time. The uniqueness of iron ores is due to the sea and freshwater.

Hematite, also spelled haematite, heavy and relatively hard oxide mineral, ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ), constitutes the most important iron ore because of its high iron content (70%) and its abundance. Besides, hematite is also one of few ores that can be classified into the field of jewelry and jade. Its name is derived from Greek "haimatites

## Why is hematite not magnetic? Explained by FAQ Blog
What is the difference between magnetic hematite and regular hematite? Manmade hematite is still made out of iron oxide in most cases. Components labeled "magnetic hematite" are typically manmade, and these are even more magnetic than natural hematite, which only has a weak magnetic draw. This form of iron oxide can be naturally magnetic, much more so than hematite.
