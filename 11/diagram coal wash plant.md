## Coal preparation plant process and equipment for coal washing
The equipment and process of the coal washing plant are related. The three most basic processes of the coal wash plant are the preparation work before the sorting (crushing, screening, grading), the sorting operation, and the processing of the selected products. At the same time, heavy medium coal preparation includes five major processes: coal

As shown in the process flow diagram, the coal is first slurried with water and fed to the first stage of the gasifier. Oxygen with a purity of 95% is provided from the Air Separation Unit (ASU) and the coal is partially combusted to maintain a temperature of 1370 °C. Raw fuel gas is produced as the coal chemically reacts with oxygen and steam.
