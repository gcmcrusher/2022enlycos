## Australian coal output to remain flat, mainly due  Mining Technology
Australian coal output to remain flat in 2022, mainly due to scheduled closures. Output will be affected by the gradual closure of some mines but will be balanced by the commencement of other projects. By GlobalData. Following a 3.5% increase in 2021, Australian coal mine production is expected to remain flat at 565.1 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022.

Coal is used in cement manufacturing, food processing, paper manufacturing and alumina refineries. Black coal was first discovered in Newcastle 1791 and coal mining and exports commenced soon after in 1799. These early coal mining activities made a significant contribution to the progress of European settlement in Australia.

Mining. In Australia, nearly 80% of coal is produced from opencut mines, in contrast to the rest of the world where opencut mining only accounts for 40% of coal production. Opencut mining is possible because coal seams are close to the surface. Such mining is cheaper than underground mining and enables up to 90% recovery of the resource.
