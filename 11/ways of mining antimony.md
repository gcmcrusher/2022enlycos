The Marlborough Antimony Company began mining in 1874. A smelter started the following year and ore and smelted mineral were exported to Europe. At its peak, the mine employed and housed more than 100 people, making it one of Marlborough's largest industries. The community included a post office, school, jetty and even a band.

USAC began mining antimony at the Stibnite Hill Mine near Thompson Falls, Montana in 1969. Mining was from 23 different drifts using room and pillar methods, slushers, jackleg drills, and electric trammers. A heavy media separator (HMS) plant and flotation mill were installed. Initial concentrates were sold to smelters until 1971. From 1971

Antimony (Sb) is a hard, brittle, silverwhite metal with a relatively high specific gravity (6.69) and a relatively low melting temperature. Antimony is a constituent in some alloys. The presence of this metal hardens the alloy, lowers the melting point, and decreases contraction during solidification. The metal's main use is to impart stiffness and hardness to lead alloys.
