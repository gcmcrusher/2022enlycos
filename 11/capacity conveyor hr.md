4. Select a suitable conveyor belt speed. 5. Convert the desired tonnage per hour (tph) to be conveyed to the equivalent in cubic feet per hour (ft3/hr). (ex. 1000 tph x 2000 / 60 = 33333 ft3/hr) 6. Convert the desired capacity in cubic feet per hour to the equivalent capacity at a belt speed of 100 fpm.

A 16inch diameter screw conveyor will convey 2,496 cubic feet per hour at the maximum recommended speed of 80rpm. The actual screw conveyor speed is calculated by dividing the Selection Capacity by the capacity at 1rpm. 1,873/31.2 = 60rpm. 60rpm is the correct speed for a 16inch diameter screw conveyor with cut and folded flights and

## Designing Inclined Screw Conveyors for Industrial Applications
The flowrate or capacity of a screw conveyor is measured in cu ft/hr. If the capacity is given in lb/hr, tn/hr, or bu/hr, it must be converted to cu ft/hr. Unlike "flood fed" screw feeders, screw conveyors are control fed at the inlet and therefore, the crosssectional trough loading is less than 100 percent.
