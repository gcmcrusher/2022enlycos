## Stirred Milling Technology – A New Concept in Fine Grinding
The vertical stirred media grinding mill uses a grinding chamber filled with small beads whereby comminution takes place by attrition between the beads. The stirring effect is caused by rotating discs mounted on a shaft. There are also stationary discs on the mill body positioned in between each rotational disc. The mill structure and its main

## Using stirred media mills in ore grinding bibliothequer
Stirred milling technology is employed in mining processing to grind particles down to fine and ultrafine particle sizes in a wide range of mining application. Stirred mills convert electric energy provided by a high torque motor to kinetic energy to the grinding media. The ore particle size reduction is resulted from the high collisions and

## Stirred Mills – Ultrafine Grinding ScienceDirect
Figure 10.1 shows the difference in energy efficiency between a laboratory ball mill and a stirred mill grinding a gold ore using 6 mm diameter alumina balls as media. At a fine grind size there is a clear advantage in energy consumption for a stirred mill over the tumbling mill. However, as the grind size coarsens, the difference in specific energy required to achieve the grind lessens.
