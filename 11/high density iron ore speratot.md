## Dense Media Separation (DMS) Plants JXSC Machine
Dense Media Separation. A heavy medium is a heavyfluid or heavy suspension fluid with a density greater than that of water (1g/cm3). The process of separating ore particles in heavy media is called Dense Media Separation / Heavy Media Separation (DMS / HMS). The heavy medium separation method is an advanced gravity beneficiation method.

A gas–solid fluidized bed has been used to separate particulate iron ore (250–500 μm in size) by segregating the particles by density.The ore particles were put into a cylindrical column of inner diameter of 100 mm and bed height of 50 mm, and were fluidized at a given air velocity u 0 /u mf = 1.2–3.2 for 10 min. u 0 and u mf are the superficial air velocity and the minimum

A dry densitybased fluidized bed separator was used to beneficiate coarse particulate iron ore. The atomized iron powder and zircon sand, with specific size fractions of 150–75 and 250–150 μm, were mixed in certain proportion to form a binary dense media.The results indicated that the binary dense media efficiently formed stable fluidization within the fluidized bed for subsequent

Efficiency data had hitherto been difficult to accumulate due to the high cost of analysing representative, and therefore large, coarse ore samples. To overcome this problem, recoverable density tracers, which are in effect artificial mineral and gangue, were manufactured in three different sizes (15 mm, 30 mm and 60 mm).

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
