In fabric conveyor belts every shaft affects the tracking. The number of these can be decreased by adjusting the design, although you must keep in mind the minimum roller diameters. Too small diameters will accelerate the ageing of the conveyor belt. Selection of a belt with special properties and materials may lead to unnecessarily high costs.
