## From Sand To Wafers Semiconductor Engineering
Purification starts by heating the sand with a reducing agent, carbon, to produce carbon monoxide and silicon. The product of this process, known as metallurgical grade silicon (MGSi), may be as much as 99% pure. Additional processing is completed until ultrapure electronic grade silicon (EGSi) is obtained. In addition to being very pure, the

To get an idea of quartz crystal structure and its symmetry properties, most figures show the crystal when viewed in the direction of either the aaxis or the caxis (a and c in Fig.1.01). This corresponds to a projection of the atoms onto the aplane and the cplane, and not to a slice of the crystal: the atoms one sees actually lie in different planes along the a and the caxis.
