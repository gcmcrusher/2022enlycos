Similarly, in rockdrilling, a hard rock demands a tough tool, whereas a soft rock demands a hard tool. These facts are quite in agreement with the experience that a tough rock causes most abrasion on a hardened steel, but if the steel is soft, or workhardening has not occurred, then a hard brittle material may be very abrasive.
