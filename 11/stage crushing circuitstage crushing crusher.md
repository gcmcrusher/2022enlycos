## 2 Stage or 3 Stage Crushing? – Trimax Machinery – Simply Better Crushers
That's another common question that may be asked. That question is easier to answer. 2 stage crushing involves just 2 crushers in a crushing plant, i,e, a primary crusher and a secondary crusher. This is usually, although not always, a jaw crusher and a cone crusher. 3 stage crushing just means that there are 3 crushers within the crushing plant.

Jaw Crushers. In compression crushing, jaw crushers tend to be more of a blunt instrument compared to cone crushers, which is why they're often used in the primary rock crushing circuit stage. Jaw crushers are also known as "rock breakers" and are used to break up larger, harder materials into more manageable pieces.
