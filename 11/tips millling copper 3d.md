## Milling Finish: Complete Guide [ Tips, Techniques, and Secrets ]
Conventional milling with a face mill causes the chip to start out thin, which sometimes leads to rubbing at the outset of chip formation that is bad for surface finish and can lead to BUE. The best finishes start the chip out fat and then thin it out before the chip releases. – Take a light cut when finishing: 0.003 – 0.010″

The second thing you need is a fairly accurate and flat CNC machine. Engraving is typically very shallow so it's important for the machine to be setup so that the cutter moves as parallel to the object to be engraved as possible. Otherwise, the depth of engraving will vary along the object, leading to a poor result.

When designing parts for Carbon DLS, it is important to have wall thicknesses of at least 0.040 in. 0.125 in. (1.016mm by 3.175mm). Anything less than the 0.040 in. value will result in features not fully forming, or severely warping. Sometimes these thin walls could result in the parts being easily broken in post processing.
