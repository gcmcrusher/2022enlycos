Limestone sand covering the bottom of the stream downstream from the application site. In doing so, habitat for bottomdwelling aquatic organisms is severely reduced. Loss of substrate habitat as a result of limestone sand application reportedly reduces aquatic insect numbers and completely eliminates crayfish from affected stream reaches.

Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into lowmagnesium and highmagnesium
