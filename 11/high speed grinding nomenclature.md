Grinding wheels contains abrasive compounds for grinding and abrasive machining operations. Such wheels are also used in grinding machines.. The wheels are generally made with composite material.This consists of coarseparticle aggregate pressed and bonded together by a cementing matrix (called the bond in grinding wheel terminology) to form a solid, circular shape.

For smaller grinding wheels (below 80mm in diameter), the maximum operating speed is provided on a separate notice which must be stored alongside the wheel. For high speeds, colourcoded stripes are also marked across the centre of the wheel. The colours are: 50m/s – Blue. 60m/s – Yellow. 80m/s – Red. 100m/s – Green.
