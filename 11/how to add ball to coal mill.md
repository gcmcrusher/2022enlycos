During the coal grinding process, the coal is crushed and its superficial area increases continually. To add new superficial area, the bond between solid molecules must be overcome, so the energy is consumed. The coal is grinded into pulverized coal in the coal ball mill mainly by means of three ways: press, strike and grind.
