## Conveyor Belt Maintenance & Common Conveyor Problems SEMCOR
Conveyor Belt Mistracking. This issue occurs when there is a conveyor belt tracking problem. Tracking is the process of managing and aligning the belt onto the correct path, and it's critical to ensuring the smooth functioning and output of your system. Mistracking, then, is when something goes wrong along this track.

## Troubleshooting Common Conveyor Belt Problems DoverMEI
There are a number of reasons that your conveyor belt is not moving at all. The first problem to consider is a blockage such as material spillage, dirt, corrosion, and other forms of gunk or debris that can cause the belt to refrain from movement. This is, once again, why regular inspections and cleaning are key when it comes to conveyor systems.

As mentioned above, slipping can be the cause of a loose belt. However, there is another cause of slipping: mistracking. This happens if the belt is not positioned on the rollers correctly. Mistracking can also lead to improper belt wear and possible breakage. So make sure the belt is correctly set up and aligned.

Normal. Too drooping. The sagging conveyor belt will bend and undulate when passing the idler, and cause the conveyor belt and the idler to slip viscously. This will easily cause the conveyor belt and the idler to wear and eventually lead to the increase of the driving power of the entire conveyor system and the spreading of materials.
