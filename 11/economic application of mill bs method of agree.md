## A systematic review of economic evaluations of health and health 
The most frequently applied economic evaluation is costeffectiveness analysis. The majority of the studies did not follow the scientific method of economic evaluation process, which consequently resulted into lack of robustness of the analyses. Capacity building on economic evaluation of health and healthrelated programs should be enhanced.
