Steps Involved In Mining And Process Of Iron. Iron Ore Smelting Process. Mar 13, iron ore is obtained in the conventional method of open cast or underground mining and conveying the ore to the surface preparation are where it is crushed, washed, and transported to the smelter. here the ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat

At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.
