Iron mineralization tends to accumulate in surface soils over time, and so old land surfaces tend to be rich in iron if there is iron in the underlying bedrock. weathering of iron minerals can be a good indicator that gold may be present. In other places, the vast majority rust colored mineralization means absolutely nothing. Iron is

Stages of rust. Stage 1. During the first stage of rust, red, black, or white deposits become noticeable on the surface of the metal. This typically appears in small patches as the overall color of the metal's surface becomes spottier and less uniform. In cast iron, this is the first step toward the formation of a permanent patina.
