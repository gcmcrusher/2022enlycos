## Amalgamation Process of Gold Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The amalgamation process, which has been widely used in a variety of forms from earliest times, depends upon the wetting and alloying of metallic gold and silver with mercury. Because of its high specific gravity and tendency to be collected by larger masses of liquid mercury or mercurycoated surfaces, this alloy, or amalgam, is readily

Designolle Process of Amalgamation. HgCl2 Fe = FeCl2 Hg, and the metallic mercury thus freed amalgamated with the gold. If no common salt was present, some mercurous chloride was formed according to the equation: 2HgCl2 Fe = Hg2Cl2 FeCl2, and the subsequent reduction of the insoluble calomel by iron was not complete.

Science. Freddie Mercury may have had the golden voice, but real mercury, that endlessly entertaining and dangerous liquid metal, has the golden touch. That is, if it touches gold it will immediately break the lattice bonds of the precious metal and form an alloy in a process known as amalgamation. A process which, when catalyzed between a dab

AMALGAMATION IN MZ Whole ore amalgamation is used for primary gold. The ratio of 415:1 Hg:Au is estimated in whole ore amalgamation. In some countries you can find ratios of 50:1 (Indonesia) The process of amalgamation itself frees up to 60% of mercury into the atmosphere.

The production of silver in South America increased significantly after 1555, when the Hg amalgamation process was introduced. This drastically reduced the use of firewood, which had become scarce around the mines, and made silver extraction profitable also in the abundant silver ores with a metal content lower than the ores worked in Europe.

Gold Amalgamation Process Amalgamation Explained. Gold absorbs mercury, forming a solid solution which may contain as much as 13 atomic per cent, of mercury. Be­yond this, an intermetallic compound containing gold or mer­cury in solution (or a second solid solution) is formed, which contains 17.5 atomic per cent, of mercury.

Mercury is fed to the mortarbox and to all plates. Apronplates are cleaned daily, and a general cleanup is made once a month. The loss of mercury averages 0.9 ounce per ton of ore milled. During a period of over 30 years, amalgamation recovered 0.167 ounce of gold per ton and left 0.0325 ounce in the tailings.

An amalgam is an alloy of mercury with another metal.It may be a liquid, a soft paste or a solid, depending upon the proportion of mercury. These alloys are formed through metallic bonding, with the electrostatic attractive force of the conduction electrons working to bind all the positively charged metal ions together into a crystal lattice structure.

The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury
