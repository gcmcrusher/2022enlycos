## Robust screens customdesigned to suit the need
K watani's success in developing custom vibrating screens for a range of scalping, sizing, dewatering, drain and rinse and desliming applications is built on decades of experience and practical research, according to CEO Kim Schoepflin. "We focus on the detail of every project, so that the screen performance suits the customer's mined product and expected output," says Schoepflin.
