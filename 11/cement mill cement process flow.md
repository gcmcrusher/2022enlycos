## The cement mill Understanding Cement
Cement manufacturing brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media normally steel balls. As the drum rotates, the motion of the balls crushes the clinker. The drum rotates approximately once every couple of seconds.
