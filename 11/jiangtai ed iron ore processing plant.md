## Repurposing mine tailings: Cold bonding of siliceous iron ore tailings 
The formation of geopolymers from mine tailings using coldbonding processes is known to be possible. Numerous coldbonding methods exist, but the hydrothermal processes involving high temperatures and pressures in the presence of steam have been found to be the most ideal. This paper presents the results of successful preliminary studies to apply hydrothermal bonding processes to mine

Nowadays, as the demand for iron ore increases together with the depletion of high grade ore deposits, mining companies have been investing to produce iron ore concentrates, such as pellet feeds (95% lower than 0.15 mm) with low level of contaminants.It is wellknown that its lower particle size negatively affects the permeability of the sintering process, restricting its use to small quantities.
