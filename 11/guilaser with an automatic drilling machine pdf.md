## DRILLING MACHINES GENERAL INFORMATION Carnegie Mellon University
A drilling machine, called a drill press, is used to cut holes into or through metal, wood, or other materials (Figure 41). Drilling machines use a drilling tool that has cutting edges at its point. This cutting tool is held in the drill press by a chuck or Morse taper and is rotated and fed into the work at variable speeds.
