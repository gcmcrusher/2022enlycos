The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns, and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is redissolved and removed from the carbon surface.

Gold. In southern Africa, two xray sorters are used to preconcentrate sulphide gold ore into two different grain size categories. While the input material has an average gold content of less than 0.8 g/t, the sorted product achieves a concentration of more than 4 g/t with an efficiency of approximately 90%.
