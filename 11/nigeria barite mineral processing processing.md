For example, HOT Mining had a project in Guizhou Province. We use machines like a vibrating feeder, a jaw crusher, a ball mill etc to make up a barite mineral processing system which has a daily processing capacity of 1000 tons. These machines are used for processing of coarse or medium barite particles.
