## Wet Milling vs Dry Milling: The Differences, Advantages, and Challenges 
Wet milling, also known as wet grinding, is a process through which particles that are suspended in a liquid slurry are dispersed in that liquid by shearing or crushing. Once the milling process is complete, these particles are ready for use or can be dried and separated for incorporation into additional products. Wet milling is more complex
