## Locations of Deposits Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Deposits are typically found in shales, cherts, limestone, dolomites and sandstone as well as hydrothermal veins or as chemically dissolved phosphate minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks. One of the world's largest phosphate deposit is the Phosphoria Formation, located in southeast Idaho.

## Mining Industry Profile Department of Energy
In 2009, an estimated 1,400 mines were operating in the United States.1 As a supplier of coal, metals, industrial minerals, sand, and gravel to businesses, manufacturers, utilities and others, the mining industry is vital to the well being of communities across the country. The map below shows a distribution of types of mining in the United States.

Abstract. Throughout the history of longwall mining, the design of the roof support system has been critical to the success of the mining operation. Early forms of longwall mining used wood props for face support and packwalls made from roof and floor rock to control caving of the immediate roof. These systems were replaced by powered roof

Mine dust refers to all kinds of coal and rock particles produced in the process of mine production and construction. According to the particle size, mineral dust can be divided into coarse dust (with a particle size larger than 40 μm), fine dust (with a particle size of 10–40 μm), tiny dust (with a particle size of 0.25–10 μm) and ultrafine dust (with a particle size smaller than 0.

A substantial number of coal deposits in the United States are located near the surface of the Earth [60, 61]. Surface mining is usually used when coal beads are located less than approximately 60 m underground . Surface mining is carried out by removing the topsoil and rock layers to uncover the coal beads.
