## Silver Mineral Physical Optical Properties, Uses, Occurrence
ETCHINGCALCITEFROMSILVERORE; Silver is an element with the chemical symbol Ag and atomic number 47. Opaque and bright silvery white with a slightly pink tint, it readily tarnishes to either gray or black. It also forms by alteration of other silverbearing minerals. Much of the world's silver production is a byproduct of refining

## Chlorargyrite: The silver mineral chlorargyrite information and pictur
Chlorargyrite, despite being an important ore of silver, is not wellrepresented in collections. This is because of its general lack of aesthetics, with the bulk of mined material being processed for the extraction of its silver content. Formerly called Cerargyrite, Chlorargyrite is the currently accepted name of this mineral today.
