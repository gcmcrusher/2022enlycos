Crushed Stones #10. Also known as stone dust or gravel screenings, Crushed Stones #10 is the pulverized stone or residue that is produced during the stone crushing and breaking process. These stone screenings are compact very easily, and they are very sturdy. Moreover, they are easy to handle and can be worked by hand.

If the crusher is jammed by a stray bit of steel, e.g., a digger bucket tooth, the mantle automatically moves down to clear the obstruction. Cone Crusher Machine Each stage of crushing produces progressively smaller sized stones. In order to produce a usable endproduct, the crushed rock has to be screened into various size categories.

Crushed stone is an angular form of construction aggregate, made by breaking quarried rock into fragments that may be sorted, sized, and recombined into a variety of products. Crushed stone is typically quarried—that is, mined using benching methods (carrying out work from a ledge in a mine or quarry) and explosives, as opposed to the mechanical digging used for extracting sand and gravel
