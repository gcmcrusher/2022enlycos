Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
