Studies on solidstate reduction of chromite have shown that the iron oxides get reduced more readily than the chromite oxides 161. Under such conditions, iron forms only one carbide Fe1C, which can dissolve chromium to form a complex carbide (Cr,Fe)7C,. Thus, an ore rich in iron oxide will have high reducibility at relatively low temperatures 171.
