Dry milling (Fig. 7.1) involves grinding the incoming grain, then processing it through a series of steps to liquefy the flour and generate fermentable sugars.Amylases are added at two points in the process—the initial slurry step, and the liquefaction step, which follows a jet cooking operation that uses hightemperature steam to swell the starch.

## Wet Milling vs Dry Milling: The Differences, Advantages, and Challenges 
Dry milling typically uses particleonparticle contact to reduce materials' size, while wet milling involves dispersing the material in a liquid and using solid, grinding elements to reduce size. Products can be broken down through either one of these processes, but wet milling, which we'll discuss first, tends to be a more intensive

## Dry milling and fractionation of grain Wikipedia
Dry milling of grain is mainly utilized to manufacture feedstock into consumer and industrial based products. This process is widely associated with the development of new biobased associated byproducts. The milling process separates the grain into four distinct physical components: the germ, flour, fine grits, and coarse grits.
