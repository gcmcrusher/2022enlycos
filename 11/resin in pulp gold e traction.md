Resin loaded with gold, mercury and copper was preeluted with thiosulfate (to remove copper) and eluted with a chloride and sulfite eluant. The majority of the mercury is eluted by the eluant and, hence, its deportment closely follows gold and the eluate would need to be treated to remove either mercury during or prior to gold electrowinning.

## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

Experimental research and production practice show that the resin in pulp process has the following advantages: 1. The adsorption capacity, adsorption rate and mechanical strength of the exchange resin were all higher than that of activated carbon.Therefore, under the same capacity, the scale of the resin slurry gold extraction plant is smaller than that of the carbon slurry gold extraction plant.

The ResininPulp (RnP) technology for gold and base metals recovers metals directly from slurries. The technology works on the same principle as CarboninPulp (CIP), which is widely used for gold recovery in a process where soluble gold from the leached slurry is adsorbed (loaded) onto carbon or resin particles.
