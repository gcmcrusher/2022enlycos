## nickel processing Extraction and refining Britannica
The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of highertemperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a
