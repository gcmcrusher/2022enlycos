## What Are Column Flotation Cells? indres
The other type of flotation cells is a column cell. Column cells are tall round tanks that use compressed air to create air bubbles via spargers or cavitation tubes. These cells are used to perform mineral separations. Column cells do not use mechanical agitation (impellers). Mixing is achieved by the turbulence provided by the rising bubbles.

The problem with flotation cells is that use a rotor for both solids suspension and air dispersion (as fine bubbles) will always be in opposition. Any technology that addresses these will improve the kinetics of attachment that said, improved mixing through more agitation will increase the kinetics of detachment.

Flotation is an extremely size sensitive process and because the RC drilling process imparts a lot of energy into the sample, the resulting fine particle size distribution is likely to be much finer than required. Also, the detergents used in RC drilling will very often react unfavorably in the flotation cell with other reagents.
