## The backend process: Step 3 – Wafer backgrinding
The Backgrinding Process. To improve the productivity of an operation, a multistep grinding operation is generally performed. The first step uses a large grit to coarsely grind the wafer and remove the bulk of the excess wafer thickness. A finer grit is used in the second step to polish the wafer and to accurately grind the wafer to the

The specific grinding energy of ferrous material under various grinding conditions have been investigated and revealed to be 20–30 J/mm 3, when cutting is the dominant mode of the process [ [33], [34], [35] ]. However, when the rubbing and ploughing became dominant, the value further exceeded to 100 J/mm 3.

Wet grinding & dry grinding While the overall aim is to reduce particles to a desired size, the grinding process can in general be conducted in two different ways – dry or wet. In the mining industry, dry grinding plants are primarily used when the downstream preparation process requires dry material, or in order to save valuable water resources.

During the grinding process, the grinding tool and the workpiece maintain a certain pressure and move relative to a certain trajectory to achieve microcutting, thereby obtaining high dimensional accuracy and low surface roughness. During dry grinding, generally no or only a small amount of lubricating abrasive is applied.

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.
