A silica sand dressing plant in the United States used biodiesel and kerosene as collectors under acidic conditions to separate biotite and ironbearing ores, reducing the Fe 2 O 3 content from 0.12% to 0.18% to 0.06% to 0.065%. The flotation method has simple iron removal process, low cost and good effect.
