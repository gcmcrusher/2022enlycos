The expansive subgrade soil was treated using 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% marble waste powder with fixed 3% lime respective combinations by weight of the soil. The optimum percent combination for this study was 10% marble waste powder with 3%lime based on soaked CBR swell, soaked CBR, swelling pressure and swelling potential test result values.

## How to Stabilize Expansive Clay Soil in Texas HD Foundations
1. Treatment with Calcium. Employing calcium for expansive clay soil treatment is an effective way to stabilize the soil. Using lime (calcium oxide) works well because it changes the mineral makeup of the clay, reducing the potential for expansion and shrinkage. Lime can be mixed with flyash and water for the most effective treatment.

3. Expansive Soils and Stabilization 3 Introduction Expansive soils could be defined as soils whose volume changes with introduction of moisture i.e. swell or shrinkage with increase or decrease in moisture content respectively. Expandable soils, expansive clays, shrinkswell soils and heavable soils are some of the synonyms used for these soils.

What is Soil Stabilization? Soil stabilization is a process by which the properties of a soil are transformed to provide permanent strength gains and enhanced engineering properties, especially with finegrained soils. Additional benefits of soil stabilization include increased durability, lower moisture absorption, reduced shrink/swell

The compaction process is the most important part of the process.
