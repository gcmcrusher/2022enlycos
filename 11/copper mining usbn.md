## Copper Statistics and Information U.S. Geological Survey
Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of lowgrade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode. An increasing share of copper is produced from acid leaching of oxidized ores.
