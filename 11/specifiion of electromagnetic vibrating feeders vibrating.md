An electromagnetic vibratory feeder works on the mechanical phenomenon of vibration to control the flow rate. Whether the material is small or large in size, the vibratory feeder works on the same principle and moves the product by vibrating the feeder. The process moves further through a combination of two forces, vibration, and gravity.
