## Aggregates Extraction Process CEMEX UK
Sand and gravel quarries are pumped to allow them to be worked dry or operated as lakes with extraction below water. A conveyor draws raw material into the processing plant, where it is washed to remove unwanted clay and to separate sand. Sand separated during processing is dewatered and stockpiled. Gravel then passes over a series of screens

## Production of natural and recycled aggregates: the environmental 
Natural aggregates (NA) are crushed and processed in crushing plants after the extraction stage in quarries. In the present study, the aggregates are divided into three scenarios, depending on the production methods. The first scenario considers the production of NA, the second scenario deals with the production of recycled aggregates (RA) with respect to construction and demolition waste, and
