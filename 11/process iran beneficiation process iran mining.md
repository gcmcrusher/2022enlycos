Mining in Iran is still under development, yet the country is one of the most important mineral producers in the world, ranked among 15 major mineralrich countries, holding some 68 types of minerals, 37 billion tonnes of proven reserves and more than 57 billion tonnes of potential reserves worth $770 billion in 2014. Mineral production contributes only 0.6 per cent to the country's GDP.

## Iron ore crushing plant, iron ore beneficiation and mining equipment 
Mining and processing of iron ore involves coarse crushing and screening. Iron ore is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the iron from the gangue minerals through screening. This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.

## Beneficiation Wikipedia
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
