## What Is Ball Ammo? Wideners Shooting, Hunting & Gun Blog
Ball ammo, by today's standards, are cartridges with jacketed bullets. On average, they do not change significantly in shape or surrender an undue portion of their mass when striking a game animal or other soft tissue. In handgun ammunition most "ball" bullets are round on the business end, often semispherical.
