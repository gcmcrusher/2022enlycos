## What is Single & Double Side Fine Grinding?
Fine Grinding (flat parts – single or doubleside) is the abrasive machining process for removing material using a bonded Superabrasive wheel at low speed with a liquid to keep the part cool. The fixed grain of a geometrically indefinable cutting shape acts like a plow (fig. 3) and material is removed by microgrooving /cutting (fig. 4).
