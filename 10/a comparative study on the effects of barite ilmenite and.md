## Ilmenite: An ore of titanium Uses and Properties Geology
Ilmenite is a black irontitanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO 3. Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium, a metal needed to make a variety of highperformance alloys. Most of the ilmenite mined worldwide is used to manufacture titanium dioxide, TiO 2, an important pigment, whiting, and polishing abrasive. ADVERTISEMENT.
