Yes, this coupe's body is battered and sports mismatched paint throughout, but it will look surprisingly sporting when cleaned up. The previous listing called this Corolla a "desert find," which would indicate dry storage conditions. As a 1974 model, I believe this would be the end of the second generation E20 lineup of Corollas.
