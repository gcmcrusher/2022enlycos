1 Wash, filter and grind the granite ore with into smaller pieces. 2 Put the ground ore into a tank containing a dilute cyanide solution and add zinc. The chemical reaction between a dilute cyanide solution and zinc will separate the gold from the ore. 3 Use a filter press to remove the gold from the solution.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
