Paper held at SAG Conference 2011 By S. Gaulocher (ABB), K.S. Stadler (ABB), Th. von Hoff (ABB), R. Veldsman (ABB), A. Fuerst (ABB) and J. Koponen (ABB): Gearless mill drives (GMDs) are the workhorse in the mineral processing industries, more specifically when it comes to grinding crushed ore and cement (in various production stages) in semiautogenous (SAG) mills and large ball mills.

The SAG mill was installed with a low ball charge, no variable speed and a fine grind was targeted (P80 106 µm). High circulating loads and difficulty achieving the target grind size were experienced. This type of ore should have been treated in a high ball charge SAG mill with variable speed capability.

## SAG vs Ball Mills COMESA
ES. EN. It's important to point out that in a SAG mill, the crushing load is composed of two components; the mineral rocks and the iron balls. Thus the mineral type affects SAG mills more than ball mills. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the foundations, the minerals don't possess a single hardness. The existence of this variance is what

The biggest characteristic of the sag mill is that the crushing ratio is large. The particle size of the materials to be ground is 300 ~ 400mm, sometimes even larger, and the minimum particle size of the materials to be discharged can reach 0.1 mm. The calculation shows that the crushing ratio can reach 3000 ~ 4000, while the ball mill's
