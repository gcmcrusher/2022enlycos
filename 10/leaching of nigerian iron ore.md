## Mineralogical characterization and leaching behavior of Nigerian 
The characterization and H 2 SO 4 leaching behavior of a Nigerian ilmenite ore following mechanical activation and alkali roasting were investigated. The effects of NaOH/ore ratio, H 2 SO 4 concentration, leaching and roasting temperature on the Ti recovery from the milled ore were examined. The results show that mechanical activation significantly enhances the dissolution of ilmenite ore.
