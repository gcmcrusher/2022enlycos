For modular plastic chain conveyors, a driven transfer can be added to cover the gap and propel product across it. This small roller conveyor is typically powered directly from an output shaft at either the tail or drive end of the conveyor. They run about 10% faster than the actual conveyor speed to ensure product clears the gap.
