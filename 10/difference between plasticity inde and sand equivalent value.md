The sand equivalent test (Figure 1) is a rapid field test to show the relative proportions of fine dust or claylike materials in fine aggregate (or granular soils). The term "sand equivalent" expresses the concept that most fine aggregates are mixtures of desirable coarse particles (e.g., sand) and generally undesirable clay or plastic

2.4.2.1 Plasticity Index. The PI is defined as the range of moisture contents over which the soil deforms plastically. The PI is thus defined to be the difference between the LL and the PL; i.e., (2.19) The PI thus is a measure of the plasticity of a soil. As such, the PI determines the amount and type of clay present in a soil.

A high value of PI indicates an excess of clay in the soil and that results in greater plasticity of that soil. If soil's plasticity index is small that shows soil is plastic for very short range of water content. This soil can hold very less amount of water and with little increase of water it reaches to its liquid limit and starts flowing.

The difference is termed the plasticity index (PI = LL PL). The liquidity index (LI), defined as LI = ( w PL ) / PI, where w is the natural moisture content, is an indicator of soil consistency in its natural insitu conditions. It is important to recognize that Atterberg limits are approximate and empirical values.

The amount of fine material available in the soil is significant in Atterberg limits and methylene blue tests. In the context of Atterberg limits, increased amount of clay minerals contained in the soil increases liquid and plastic limit values; however, increasing sand content reduces the moisture content reducing the water retention capacity of the soil which in return reduces the plasticity
