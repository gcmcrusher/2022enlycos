## Is it possible to find gold deposited together with iron pyrite?
Answer (1 of 2): That's actually very common. Pyrite (not 'iron pyrite', just 'pyrite') is a very common mineral, and is one of several common minerals that tend to be deposited in the same places and the same time, along with gold (the other most common mineral often associated with gold is quar

## Quartz and Gold Relationship: Why Are They Found Together?
Quartz and gold are often found together because they are chemically complimentary at a molecular level and because of the accommodating structure and formation of quartz. Since gold is a softer metal, it can flow through and form inside the mineral of quartz and become trapped inside as the stone develops. Within this article, we will quickly

Pyrite as an Ore of Gold. The most important use of pyrite is as an ore of gold. Gold and pyrite form under similar conditions and occur together in the same rocks. In some deposits small amounts of gold occur as inclusions and substitutions within pyrite. Some pyrites can contain 0.25% gold by weight or more.

Gold and Pyrite are natural substances and look real and similar, tricking each one's eye. Each time the crystals stretch and twist, they break the bonds of nearby atoms. Fool's Gold is found inside rocks beneath the Earth's surface, sometimes nearreal gold deposits. Gold and Pyrite together are friends of each other.
