## Limestone Wikipedia
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into lowmagnesium and highmagnesium
