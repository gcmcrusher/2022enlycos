## Coal Transport Basic Mining Process/Terminology Introduction 
A method of coal transport used in some special instances, where mining is taking place in steep seams, is hydraulic transport. There are some mines (notably in New Zealand) where the coal is mined hydraulically using high pressure water jets (or "monitors" ). From that point gravity is used to carry the water and coal along steel troughs or
