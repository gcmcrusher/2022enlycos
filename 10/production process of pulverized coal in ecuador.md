Raw coal enters the top of the pulverizer through the raw coal feed pipe. The raw coal is then pulverized between the roll and rotating ring. Hot air is forced in through the bottom of the pulverizing chamber to remove unwanted moisture and transport the coal dust up through the top of the pulverizer and out the exhaust pipe directly to the burner.

Coal is the most abundant energy source, and around 40% of the world's electricity is produced by coal combustion. The emission generated through it put a constraint on power production by coal combustion. There is a need to reduce the emissions generated through it to utilize the enormous energy of coal for power production.

Production. Fly ash is produced from the combustion of coal in electric utility or industrial boilers. There are four basic types of coalfired boilers: pulverized coal (PC), stokerfired or traveling grate, cyclone, and fluidizedbed combustion (FBC) boilers. The PC boiler is the most widely used, especially for large electric generating units.

Boilers. To efficiently combust coal, it needs to be pulverized into fine particles (100μm) before being placed in a boiler. A pulverizer (coal pulverizer) is installed for this purpose, and pulverizes pieces of coal several centimeters in diameter down to fine particles. The pulverizer includes pulverization, drying and classification functions.

In the slurryfeed process, the pulverized coal is mixed with water to form a slurry that is pumped into the gasifier via a single burner at the top of the reactor. Contact with oxygen starts the gasification reactions. In the slurryfeed process, the inside of the gasifier is lined with refractory bricks to protect against the high heat loads.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.
