Flotation agents are chemical agents used in the mineral flotation process which can adjust the surface properties of the minerals, increase or decrease the floatability of the minerals, and make the pulp properties and foam stability more conducive to mineral separation. Common flotation agents are collectors, foaming agents, inhibitors, activators, dispersants, flocculants and defoamers.
