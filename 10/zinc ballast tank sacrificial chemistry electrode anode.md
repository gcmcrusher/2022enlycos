## Sacrificial Anode an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Sacrificial anodes may be fitted within the hull, and are often fitted in ballast tanks. However, magnesium anodes are not used in the cargoballast tanks of oil carriers owing to the 'spark hazard'. Should any part of the anode fall and strike the tank structure when gaseous conditions exist, an explosion could result.

## Cathodic protection Wikipedia
Cathodic protection (CP; / k æ ˈ θ ɒ d ɪ k / ()) is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. A simple method of protection connects the metal to be protected to a more easily corroded "sacrificial metal" to act as the anode.The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected metal.

Sacrificial anodes have become a standard practice for the protection of ballast tanks of merchant vessels against corrosive damage. A well protected tank should extend the life span of a ship and consequently enhances its economic value. An in situ survey comprising more than 100 merchant vessels provided the opportunity to measure the impact of these anodes on the life expectancy of these
