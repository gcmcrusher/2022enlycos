Bauxite ore contains sufficiently high levels of aluminium oxides and suitably low levels of iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and silica (SiO 2) to be economically mineable. The amount of reactive silica is particularly important as this form of silica consumes the caustic soda needed to make alumina, thus low reactive silica is desirable.
