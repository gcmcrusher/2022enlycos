## Copper Slag an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The chemical composition of copper slag varies with the type of furnace. The typical composition of smelting slags is Fe (as FeO, Fe 3 O 4) 30–40%; SiO 2 35–40%; Al 2 O 3 up to 10%; and CaO up to 10%. The density of copper slag varies between 3.16 and 3.87 g/cm 3 based on the amount of iron content. The average specific gravity of copper

The production of selfcompacting concrete was done with the addition of copper slag in different amounts to replace the sand and fixed amounts of metakaolin as a binder material. The compressive strength of all of the mixes increases, but the maximum strength is observed when 20% CS is added as a replacement for sand.

## Copper Slag Geopolymer – Future Materials Bank
Slag is used as both aggregate, and cementitious binder, forming an inorganic polymer concrete (also known as a "geopolymer"). The slag is atomized into a powder, and activated in the presence of an alkali, setting off an inorganic polymerization reaction. This material makes use of the inherent hightemperature industrial process of refining
