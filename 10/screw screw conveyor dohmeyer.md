## Screw Conveyor Design, Application and Selection Guidelines, History USA
The design of the screw is based on the theory of the inclined plane. The screw conveyor began to evolve in the late 1800s and was used as a means of increasing food and grain production to meet the needs of the rapidly growing American population. The first feed mills used screw conveyors throughout the process.

## Sizing a Screw Conveyor
The first step in sizing a screw conveyor is to determine the diameter. The diameter is a function of the rate of the conveyed material, its density, trough fill level, screw pitch and speed of the screw. To ease the calculation, most screw conveyors are full pitch, meaning the distance from flight to flight is the same as the diameter, and are
