Step 8 Curing. Let the concrete can rest and begin to cure (get hard). The curing process lasts 28 days, with the first 48 hours being the most critical. Apply a liquid chemical curing and sealing compound to help the concrete cure slowly and evenly, which helps reduce cracks, curling, and surface discoloration.

In general Batch mixers are two types.
