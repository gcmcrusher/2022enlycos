Background. Coal ash is produced at coalfired power plants. Coal is pulverized and then burned to generate electricity. The particles that remain after burning coal are called coal ash, principally consisting of fly ash and bottom ash.Other coal combustion byproducts are boiler slag, flue gas desulfurization gypsum, and other kinds of flue gas desulfurization residues.
