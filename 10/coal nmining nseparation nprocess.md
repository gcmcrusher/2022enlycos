The coal industry, of course, faces a number of growing challenges. In some cases success means reducing maintenance with a robust fluid bed dryer, or improving automation through advanced instrumentation, process control, or dynamic simulations of mining operations. Other times, water recovery can be a significant competitive advantage.

Abstract. A method is disclosed for the separation of coal from run of mine (Rom) coal containing particles of coal and refuse, which comprises conditioning the rom coal with a coupling agent capable of selectively coating the particulate coal to the substantial exclusion of coating the refuse, which coupling agent is at least one alcohol containing from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms.
