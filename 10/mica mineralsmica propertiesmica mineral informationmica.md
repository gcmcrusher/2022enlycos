It is also worth noting that mica is an excellent insulator that does not conduct electricity and heat. Interpretation of the concept. This group of minerals has perfect cleavage in one direction.

The mica group of sheet silicate minerals include several closely related materials having nearly perfect basal cleavage. All are monoclinic, with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals, and are similar in chemical composition. Mica is a collection of silicate minerals having amounts of aluminium, iron, magnesium, potassium and water.

## Mica Properties and Meaning Photos Crystal Information
Hi Kevin, My understanding is Schist is a coarsegrained metamorphic rock that consists of layers of different minerals (Mica among them along with chlorite, talc, hornblende, and graphite) and can be split into thin irregular plates. Where as Mica is it's own mineral and forms in flaky layers. Reply.
