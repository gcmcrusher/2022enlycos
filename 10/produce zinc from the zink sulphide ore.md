Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world, although more than 40 percent of the world's output originates in North America and Australia. The common zinccontaining minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS), a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S], and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or smithsonite (ZnCO3).

The chemical analyses of the Angouran mixed sulphide–oxide lead and zinc ore sample are given in Table 2, and they show that the sample is characterized by a very high Zn and low Pb content. The percentage of the zinc in the oxidised part is 70.5%. This illustrates the importance of the oxidised part of the ore in terms of zinc recovery.

## Zinc smelting Wikipedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless specific

The reaction of the final step of extraction of zinc is. 2 Z n O C → 2 Z n C O 2. Since the boiling point of zinc is way back at 1180 K, the zinc formed immediately vaporises and distils over leaving behind nonvolatile impurities such as cadmium, lead and iron. This gas containing zinc vapours is collected and cooled to yield solid zinc.

Historically, zinc had been produced from its oxide ores before the discovery of its sulphide ores, which are far more abundant in nature. The most common ore of zinc is zinc sulphide, also called zinc blende. There are two main methods of producing zinc: the pyrometallurgical method and the hydrometallurgical method.
