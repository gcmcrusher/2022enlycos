A typical circuit, as shown in Figure 2, can consist of either an Autogenous (AG), SemiAutogenous (SAG) combined with a ball mill. In an AG mill no grinding media is added, while in SAG mills the charge is supplemented with steel balls. As more steel balls are added the transition from a SAG to a ball mill occurs.
