## What Happens to Potassium Carbonate When Dissolved in Water?
When dissolved in water, it is converted to its constituents, potassium cation and carbonate anion, and the solution becomes alkaline. Potassium ions and carbonate are naturally occurring in nature, so it is environmentally friendly. The presence of carbonate ions increases the pH of the water, so the water containing it must be adjusted for pH

## What Happens If You Mix Potassium Carbonate And water?
Therefore, if you put Potassium Carbonate into the water, it will likely dissolve. The water turns the chemical substance into basic. K2CO3 →2K CO3². K OH (ion from water)→ KOH. 2H CO3 → H2CO3 ( it become less acid and less ionized) Therefore, you can dissolve this substance into the water with some quick stirs.

Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is a watersoluble inorganic compound that is primarily derived from potash. It is industrially prepared by reacting potassium hydroxide and carbon dioxide. The solution crystallizes to form potash hydrate, which can further be heated above 200°C to produce the anhydrous salt.
