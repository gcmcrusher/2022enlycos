## The Complete Guide to Classification in Python
This article serves as a reference for both simple and complex classification problems. By "simple", we designate a binary classification problem where a clear linear boundary exists between both classes. More complex classification problems may involve more than two classes, or the boundary is nonlinear. For such problems, techniques such

The term "droop" is used to describe the drop in the outlet pressure, below the original setpoint, as flow increases. Droop can also be caused by significant changes in the inlet pressure (from the value when the regulator output was set). As the inlet pressure rises from the initial setting, the outlet pressure falls.
