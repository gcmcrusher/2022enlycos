## PPT – Applications of Abrasive Grinding Wheels PowerPoint presentation 
Abrasive cutting, also known as grinding, is the process of removing steel from small chips with irregularly formed abrasive particles. These fragments can also be found as a groundsheet, bonded spokes, and polished belts. Small abrasive grains are tied together by a binding film in grinding wheels. Any grain of abrasive has the ability to be a cutting edge. When it moves through the workpiece

The grinding wheel is standard equipment within the metallurgy industry. It is used to cut metals in different sizes, shapes, and efficiency. The grinding wheel is composed of two things; the abrasive cutting compound used for grinding and the bond formed between the abrasives. – A free PowerPoint PPT presentation (displayed as a Flash slide show) on PowerShow id: 924ec7NTg5M
