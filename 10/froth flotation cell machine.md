Under conditions prevailing in the Standard "SubA" Flotation Machine, the amount of air entering the cell will vary as a result of differences in pulp heads, pulp density, and specific gravity. The use of supercharged flotation overcomes any of these variable conditions by increasing the air density under positive pressure within the pulp.
