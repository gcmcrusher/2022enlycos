There are 27 phosphate mines in Florida, covering nearly half a billion acres. Phosphate pebbles were found in the Peace River in the 1880's, setting off a mining rush where Hardee, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Polk counties meet. "Bone Valley" was named for the large number of prehistoric fossils found there.

Most of the phosphate in Nauru has been extracted through strip mining, which is the removal of large layers of earth in order to reach the minerals underneath. This practice leaves the earth largely barren, infertile, and unable to sustain plant life. Currently, about 90% of the island is covered in jagged and exposed heaps of petrified coral
