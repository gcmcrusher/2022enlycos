## Magnetic Separation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Magnetic separation takes advantage of the fact that magnetite is strongly magnetic (ferromagnetic), hematite is weakly magnetic (paramagnetic), and most gangue minerals are not magnetic (diamagnetic). A simple magnetic separation circuit can be seen in Figure 1.2.5 [9].A slurry passes by a magnetized drum; the magnetic material sticks to the drum, while the nonmagnetic slurry keeps flowing.

## Magnetic Filtration Applications and Benefits Machinery Lubrication
The fluid conditions that best facilitate the separation of magnetic particles are low oil viscosity (ISO VG 32 vs. ISO VG 320 for instance) and low oil flow rate (2 GPM vs. 50 GPM). Even extremely small, onemicron particles can be separated from the oil if both of these fluid conditions exist concurrently.
