## Dynamic Milling vs. HighFeed Ramping DAPRA
Highfeed ramping is simply profile milling any typical twodimensional shape with the addition of a simultaneous ramp in the Zaxis. Most CAM systems offer this approach as a standard tool path. The depth of cut is light, but the feed rate is typically hundreds of inches per minute, achieving outstanding MRR that is very competitive with

Highfeed milling is a category of face milling with shallow depths of cut and significantly higher feed rates. This application is an excellent choice if you are looking to machine a large quantity of material in a short period of time. Indexable tools with a low pressure angle of approx. 10° to 15° are often suitable for highspeed milling.

Moderate feed milling cutters with a 22.5° cutting edge angle. The high feed milling (HFM) cutters are intended for machining with extremely high feed per tooth at shallow depths of cut, while the moderate feed milling cutters are applied when machining up to a twofold depth with lower feed. Moderate feed is less than HFM, but still very common.

A High Feed End Mill is a type of HighEfficiency Milling (HEM) tool with a specialized end profile that allows the tool to utilize chip thinning to have dramatically increased feed rates. These tools are meant to operate with an extremely low axial depth so that the cutting action takes place along the curved edge of the bottom profile. This allows for a few different phenomena to occur:
