Analytical formulas are developed for assessment of the influence of dusty air on the energy consumption in a hammertype crusher applied to coal batch with a high content of fines. Analytical and experimental approaches are adopted. The ≤3 mm class present in the coal batch supplied for crushing forms a dust–air suspension, which is not crushed by hammer impact but significantly increases

For the 1in. screen below the roll crusher the capacity has no correction factor and the area needed is 32/2.1 = 15.2 sq ft. To handle the output from a 40 x 24 roll crusher the screen will have to be at least 24 in. wide. Perhaps it will be more effective to use one continuous screen of at least 20.1 15.2 = 35.3 sq ft.

Power Consumption of Roll Crushers. Within the same reduction ratio the power consumption of roll crushers varies widely. The power required could be expressed by the general equation (6.8) P = capacity × reduction ratio × work index. In industry, the low pressure smooth surfaced rolls are designed to draw 8–50 kW of power under dry conditions.
