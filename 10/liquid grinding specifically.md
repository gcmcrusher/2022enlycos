## Liquid Nitrogen an overview ScienceDirect Topics
15.3.3.1.1 Cryogenic Grinding. Cryogenic grinding uses liquid nitrogen to freeze material prior to feeding it into the mill and to maintain a low temperature throughout the system. It is used for soft or very tough materials that cannot be ground at normal temperatures. By freezing the pellets, they are shattered as they pass through the mill.

## Understanding Grinding Fluid Canadian Metalworking
Fluid use is very important in the grinding process because it reduces the effects of friction, removes heat from the work zone, and increases material removal. Most important, grinding fluid increases the material removal rate without increasing the damage to the surface of the workpiece. Many cutting fluids are available today, so it is wise
