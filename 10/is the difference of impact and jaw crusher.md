The biggest difference between jaw crusher and impact crusher is: jaw crusher is always used as the primary crusher while the impact crusher is always used as the secondary crusher.. Jaw crusher has the characteristic of high impact resistance. So it is suitable for the primary crushing. The impact resistance of impact crusher is small, but it is good at shaping the product.

Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and mediumsized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.

Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The highspeed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.
