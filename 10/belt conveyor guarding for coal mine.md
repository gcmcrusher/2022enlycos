## Belt Conveyor Fatal Nip Hazards SPC/Tech/SI1/11
The dangers associated with idler nip hazards on heavy duty belt conveyors is addressed in a separate circular first published in 2002 (SPC/TECH/S15/05). The process of adopting nip point guarding as well as peripheral guarding has been progressive, usually in response to an accident resulting from ineffective or missing peripheral guards.
