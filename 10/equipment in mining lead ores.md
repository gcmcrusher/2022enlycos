Once the ore is removed from veins (narrow channels) or lodes (roughly spherical deposits) in the Earth, usually at depths of about 60 metres, the ore is treated at concentrating mills. Here the ore is finely crushed, sometimes to particle diameters of less than 0.1 millimetre (0.004 inch), and then treated by one of several mineral concentration processes. Such processes are designed to

Surface Mining. Surface mining includes numerous techniques and is the most common method for nonfuel minerals, producing 97% of the amount mined. Miners choose surface extraction for minerals located close to the surface. There are three main ways to mine on the surface. These methods include quarrying, openpit mining, and strip mining.

In some cases, where resources are defined by clear differences in the geology of the ore and waste, this will have little effect. In others, such as with lowgrade porphyry copper deposits, a minor reduction in cutoff grade resulting from the introduction of higher capacity mining equipment can lead to an increase in available resource tonnage.
