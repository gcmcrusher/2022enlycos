The described invention relates to the processing of iron ore, particularly taconite ore. In particular, the invention relates to the separation of the iron containing component from the silicious and other gangue components such as phosphorus compounds in low grade iron ore. Typically, the separation is accomplished by a flotation process to remove the gangue to recover the iron component.

Hematite is easier to floated than magnetic, which could be separated by positive flotation. As the density of iron ore is much higher than that of gangue mineral, gangue mineral is more likely to attach to the foam than iron ore. Therefore, for iron ore, reverse flotation is more advantageous than positive flotation.
