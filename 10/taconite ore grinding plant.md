Though taconite was identified as an ironbearing rock on the Iron Ranges of northern Minnesota long before the 1950s, it wasn't until then that it was extracted, processed, and shipped to steel mills on the Great Lakes. As natural ore reserves diminished, taconite became an alternative source of iron that allowed the Iron Range to continue mining operations in a changing global economy.
