Openpit mining. Openpit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an openpit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Openpit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.
