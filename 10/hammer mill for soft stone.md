## Soft Stone Hand Hammer Sculpture & Carving
Product Description. This unhardened 11/2lb square striking hammer produces a softer blow, which can provide more control when working in softer stone. Excellent for lettering and detail work, the Soft Stone Hammer is also less likely to bruise the stone and will promote less wear on lighter carving tools.
