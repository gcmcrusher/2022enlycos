## Straight facts on the environmental impact of coal: CO2 emissions 
Burning 1 MWh of coal emits 3.9 pounds of sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of the main causes of acid rain (EPA). Coal plants are the largest source of SO2, creating 64% of all humanemitted SO2 in 2014 (DOE). Thanks to increased regulations and power plant upgrades, as well as the rapid shift to natural gas, SO2 emissions have been

## Environmental pollution by wastewater from brown coal processing – a 
For example, a highly toxic and darkcolored phenolic wastewater from a lignite pyrolysis factory was filled into a former opencast pit, forming a large wastewater disposal pond. This caused an extensive environmental pollution, calling for an ecologically and economically acceptable strategy for remediation.

Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash.They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land. Many things that are useful to people produce pollution.

Victorian brown coal has a high moisture content, containing more moisture than black coal – it can contain up to 70 percent water. This high moisture content makes long distance transportation uneconomic and so brown coal is not currently used for export markets. But that doesn't mean big polluting companies don't want to try.

Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25–35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.
