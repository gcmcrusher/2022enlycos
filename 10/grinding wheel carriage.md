A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond, which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.
