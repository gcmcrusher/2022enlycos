## Ball Mills Or Vertical Roller Mills: Which Is Better For Cement Grinding?
Ball mills are factory made and transported to the plant site of the buyer while VRM is built on the site of the cement plant. This helps to reduce cost and complicated logistics issues. The equipment cost is, however, higher for a VRM than a ball mill. So these are the pros and cons of the two technologies and a cement manufacturing company

## Ball mill upgrade cuts energy consumption by 25%
At a cement plant, there are a number of pathways to achieve this. But one of the most important is the adoption of technology that reduces energy consumption, while preserving – or even increasing – production: the addition of a hydraulic roller press (HRP) to a ball mill circuit is a proven example of what can be achieved in this regard.

## Coal Mill in Cement Plant Vertical Roller Mill & AirSwept Ball Mill
The ball mill is a traditional coal pulverizer machine, which has been widely used since it was invented. In the cement plant, the new dry process cement manufacturing requires the moisture content of coal powder to be 0.5% ~ 1.5%, while that of raw coal is 1.5% ~ 4.0%. Therefore, the ball mill should have a drying function besides grinding.
