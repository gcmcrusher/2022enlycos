## Vertical Roller Mills for Coal Grinding Industrial Efficiency 
Vertical roller mills (VRM) can replace ball mills or tube mills used for preparing coal. Today VRMs with capacities up to 50 tph are the dominant technology for coal grinding. According to MIIT, grinding media wear in a VRM will only be 5 to 10 g/ton of coal powder, as compared to 100 g/ton of coal powder in a ball mill.
