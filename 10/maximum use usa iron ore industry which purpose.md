## The Smelting Industry: Global Importance And Risks
1. Environmental Safety. Smelting causes much pollution and damage to the environment. Release of gases like sulfur dioxide from sulfide ores into the atmosphere, has been reported as causing acid rain. In the long term, acid rains cause acidity in lakes and soils thereby negatively interfering with vegetation and wildlife.

## Iron ore Wikipedia
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

The US iron and steel industry has paralleled the industry in other countries in technological developments. In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coal in ore smelting, adopted the Bessemer process, and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills.In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the open hearth furnace, then the basic oxygen steelmaking process.
