Cone crushers are widely used in the mining and aggregates industries to reduce the size of blasted rock. A cone crusher consists of a fixed conic liner called concave and inside it a smaller moving liner called mantle. The mantle is suspended on an eccentrically rotating shaft. As the eccentric is turned, rock particles fed to the crusher will be squeezed and crushed between the mantle and
