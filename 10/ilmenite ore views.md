Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium metal, and its importance is only growing with time. As the global demand for titanium has increased rapidly over the past five years, with sponge shipments and exports of titanium scrap increasing 20% and 14% respectively between 2018 and 2019, the value of ilmenite has increased in response.

Ilmenite is one of the most significant ores of the metal titanium. It is mined as an important industrial mineral in several deposits throughout the world. Many of those deposits are in heavy placer sands. Ilmenite is very similar in structure to Hematite, and is essentially the same as Hematite with roughly half the iron replaced with titanium..

Ilmenite (FeTiO 3) is the essential titanium ore, accounting for up to 47% of the aggregate global production of TiO 2, a whitening pigment.The leading worldwide provider of ilmenite ore is Australia, followed by South Africa, China and Canada. The ore materializes as two alternative morphologies: heavy sand ilmenite, the most utilized morphology, and hard rock.

"The sulphate ilmenite market has rebounded fast, we've seen an increase from $80 up to $120 to China," one source said. Producers attributed the increase in prices to higher activity in TiO 2 and rationalisation of the Chinese industry, as well as tighter ilmenite supply owing to lower iron ore prices.

What is Ilmenite? Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks, sediments, and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world. Apollo astronauts found abundant ilmenite in lunar rocks and the lunar regolith. Ilmenite is a black irontitanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO 3.. Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium, a metal needed to make a variety of highperformance alloys.
