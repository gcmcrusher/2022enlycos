## The Cement Manufacturing Process Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

3. Grinding: The clinkers as obtained from the rotary kiln are finely ground in ball mills and tube mills. During grinding, a small quantity, about 3 to 4 per cent, of gypsum is added. The gypsum controls the initial setting time of cement. If gypsum is not added, the cement would set as soon as water is added.
