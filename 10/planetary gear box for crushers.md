The planet gears are joined by a carrier which in turn is attached to the output shaft. The design of the planetary gearbox is relatively simple, including a central sun gear, an outer ring (also known as an internal gear since its tooth face inward), a carrier, and the planetary gears. Input power to the sun gear results in spinning.
