I recently found a small bench top horizontal milling machine made by the Barker Engineering Company, Cleveland Ohio. It's about a 6 hour drive one way from me and I really don't have the time to go see it. Cute little thing, no overhead arm option, electric motor is about 1/4 the size of the whole unit, table has graduated collars the XY

The knee design is better. Bridgeport vertical millers, the most popular milling machine design ever, use the knee. The only modern milling machine I can think of that DOESN'T have a knee is a Barker, which is a little benchmounted thing. All the big machines seem to use the knee design. That sort of speaks for itself.

Found a Barker model AM horizontal mill on the local Craigslist. But it's a sturdy little machine for its size. I have a Barker PM from 1954, a real early one, that I bought for $400 a few years ago. I cleaned it up, and it's been a faithful workhorse. I have it set up with a special arbor and a 3" x 0.020" slotting saw blade, and I use it

Running as a true horizontal will certainly allow you to cut mild steel. It looks like a wonderful robust little machine. So I wouldn't worry about its ability to mill steel, or anything softer. One thing to consider, if you buy a small mill that is 500 or 1000 miles away even within a 1500 mile radius, you will be able to put it on a pallet
