Motor and Gearbox Specifications. When carrying out belt conveyor load calculation, the total payload on the belt conveyor as well as the area the load will take up on the conveyor need to be considered. Most belt conveyors are designed with the belt being dragged over a stainless steel deck. This causes friction between the belt and the deck.
