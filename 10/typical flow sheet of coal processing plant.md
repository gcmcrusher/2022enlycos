As shown in the process flow diagram, the coal is first slurried with water and fed to the first stage of the gasifier. Oxygen with a purity of 95% is provided from the Air Separation Unit (ASU) and the coal is partially combusted to maintain a temperature of 1370 °C. Raw fuel gas is produced as the coal chemically reacts with oxygen and steam.

Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semihard cokingcoal, semisoft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

A coalfired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coalfired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coalfired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin
