## Need chatter fighting techniques Don Terrill's SpeedTalk
I tryied once, one of those ball drive serdi style cutters but no luck, I gave up, the setup is against all basic rules for machining, 10° or 7° clearance angles built on most blades are outrageous. By using $150.00 carbide pilots and a high dollar "floating spindle" machine to cut valve seats, they are just trying to make work an ill system.

Let's look at ball screw and helical rack and pinion drives more closely. There are many different grades of ball screws (C0 though C10) which determine accuracy and repeatability (see chart to the left). C0 through C5 are ground ball screws, where the screw is ground for precise channel depth for the ball nut ball bearings to ride in.
