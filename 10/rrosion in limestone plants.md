## 4 Proven Reasons To Put Rocks On Top Of Potted Plants
1. Improve aesthetics of the potted plant. The first reason home gardeners choose to put rocks on top of their potted plants is the aesthetic looks. Some prefer the look of rocks instead of the bare soil. If your main goal is to improve the look of the plant, choose a rock color that compliments the color of the plant.

Erosion is the process where rocks are broken down by natural forces such as wind or water. There are two main types of erosion: chemical and physical. Chemical erosion occurs when a rock's chemical composition changes, such as when iron rusts or when limestone dissolves due to carbonation. In physical erosion, the rock breaks down but its chemical composition remains the same, such as

## Limestone origins — Science Learning Hub
Limestone origins. Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of more than 50% calcium carbonate. Although it occurs in many different forms, its origins can be traced back to either chemical or biochemical processes that occurred in the geological past, often tens to hundreds of millions of years ago.

Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

Water rushing unchecked down a slope carves a path and washes away topsoil, uproots plants and trees, and carries fertilizers and other chemicals into our water supply. Fortunately, strategic placement of gravel does wonders in controlling this liquid rampage. On a sloped landscape, gravel acts as a barrier to prevent soils from draining away.
