## Predicting the effect of operating and design variables in grinding in 
Grinding media size is one of the most important variables in the operation of stirred mills, since it directly influences the probability to capture particles and the magnitude of the collisions. An alternative to an increase in frequency of collisions in a stirred mill is an increase in volume of grinding media elements in the mill
