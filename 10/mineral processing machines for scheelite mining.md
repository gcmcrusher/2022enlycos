## How to Extract Tungsten from Ore? Mining Pedia
4. Tungsten Mineral Processing Cases. To Wrap Up. Tungsten is a rare metal, which is widely distributed and exists in almost all kinds of rocks. Because of its low content, it can only be enriched through relevant geological processes before forming ore deposits for mining. There are more than 20 kinds of tungsten ore found in nature.

Scheelite is a calcium tungstate mineral with the chemical formula CaWO4. It is an important ore of tungsten. In nature, the scheelite is generally of sandstone type and composite type (fine vein disseminated type and greisen skarn composite type), which is often symbiotic with various nonferrous metal minerals such as molybdenum and bismuth.

Scheelite is quite readily floatable with fatty acids in an alkaline circuit with soda ash and sodium silicate. Other nonmetallic minerals such as calcite and fluorspar are often present in the ore, so a high grade scheelite concentrate is difficult to produce by flotation. Sulphides, if present, must be floated ahead of the scheelite. Conclusion

Scheelite and wolframite are the main tungsten resources in the world. Due to the longterm overexploitation of wolframite, its resources have been declining year by year. Therefore, scheelite is one of the main minerals currently used in the development and utilization of tungsten resources. How to obtain highgrade scheelite resources, its beneficiation method is particularly important.
