A critical point in the operation of large jaw crushers is the arrangement of the swing jaw and its supporting shaft. While in most crushers the jaw is pressed on the shaft and the latter swings in frame, in the jaw crusher the opposite principle is used—shaft is clamped in frame and jaw swings on the shaft! Another point has been lubrication.
