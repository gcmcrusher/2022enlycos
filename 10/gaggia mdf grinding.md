The Gaggia MDF is a decent little coffee grinder that tends to get a bad rap in serious espresso circles. It will never compete with the more expensive semipro grinders (e.g. Mazzer, Cimbali, MADCAP), but it can grind some decent shots with a little work. The most frustrating thing about the MDF is the size of the grind adjustment steps.
