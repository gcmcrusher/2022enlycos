## Gold Cyanide an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The most widely used hydrometallurgical process in gold extraction from ores is cyanidation. Leaching of gold in an aerated, alkaline cyanide solution is an electrochemical reaction in which the cathodic reduction of oxygen is accompanied by the gold oxidation and dissolution as gold cyanide complex as shown in Eq.

The cyanidation process of gold extraction or the use of cyanide is the most common leaching process, used in the extraction of gold from its ores. Extracting gold from scrap means that you will collect any goldcontaining scrap metals and extract the gold from them. These metals can include jewellery and other electronics that are out of date.

Process. Cyanide can be used to extract gold, either in a controlled mill environment, or more crudely on rock piles in the open. Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water. The cyanide binds to the gold ions, and makes them soluble in water, thereby allowing separation from the rock.

What is cyanide and why do we need cyanidefree gold leaching process? Cyanide (CN –) has been used since 1889 to recover gold from hard rock. As sodium cyanide (NaCN), it reacts with gold, oxygen (O), and water (H 2 O) to form a gold cyanide complex (Na [Au(CN) 2] ) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The chemical reaction dubbed the "Elsner Equation", named after its discoverer, is shown below:

The process: The ore is ground and crushed to make a slurry . The treated gold then has sodium cyanide added to it. and the following reaction: Au 2. CN→. Au(CN) 2In this form the gold is now soluble. This process is known as leaching. This reaction is normally carried out at a . pH of 1011 as this prevents cyanide ion being converted to

remove the gold cyanide, and the gold metal is produced using a process called electrowinning. Due to the rapid reactions taking place in an agitated leach process, automatic pH control is strongly recommended. pH is controlled between 11 and 12 during the leaching process. pH values below 11 favor the formation of HCN, hydrogen cyanide

## Dissolve Gold and Silver with Cyanide Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The addition of gold or silver to an alkaline sodium cyanide solution will cause the gold and silver to react with the cyanide and dissolve into the solution in a process called cyanidation. This process is more frequently referred to as leaching. As well as reacting with the precious metals, the cyanide will react with iron, copper or zinc
