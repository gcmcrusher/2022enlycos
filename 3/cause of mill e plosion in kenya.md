Yes, flour is flammable and also explosive. We all know that it is primarily composed of starch, a storage component of plants and carbohydrates. It is flammable under the temperature of 380degree Fahrenheit. When the hydrocarbon encounters heat and oxygen, it goes through combustion and produces waste products carbon dioxide.
