Abstract: High cost and scarcity of river sand is one of the main problem faced by construction industry today. Use of substitutions like offshore sand in particular to replace river sand is on the rise. Quarry dust is another alternative for river sand. However, full replacement of river sand with quarry dust is viewed with scepticism.
