## Introduction of Centerless Grinding JinXi Precision Mechanical
A machining process that uses an abrasive wheel to remove unwanted materials from the external diameter of a part is referred to as centerless grinding. In centerless grinding, the part is not held stationary. But centered grinding has a fixture to hold the part still. To perform grinding action, the part is supported in between two rotating

## Centerless grinding Wikipedia
Centerless grinding is a machining process that uses abrasive cutting to remove material from a workpiece. Centerless grinding differs from centered grinding operations in that no spindle or fixture is used to locate and secure the workpiece; the workpiece is secured between two rotary grinding wheels, and the speed of their rotation relative to each other determines the rate at which material

This is where ceramic grinding comes in. Ceramics are quite hard after sintering. Some are several times harder than steel. It's only through grinding, lapping, and other abrasive processes that components achieve their final shapes. Doing so requires a very rigid and accurate machine tool. It also needs the right wheel.
