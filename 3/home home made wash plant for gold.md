## » Final Cleanup and Recovery of Your Gold
Final Cleanup #2. Final Cleanup #3. Some miners like to "cleanup" their sluice boxes after every hour of operation. Some prefer to do cleanup at the end of the day. Others will go for days at a time before cleaning up. This is all a matter of preference and seldom has much to do with the actual needs of the sluice box.

## Build Your Own Dry Washer And Dig For Desert Gold EzineArticles
A dry washer is a piece of equipment that is used to separate gold from sand with pulsations of air coming up through a porous cloth medium. This allows the gold to settle downward and get caught. It is the gold prospecting equipment of choice in dry desert areas. The vibrations and flow of air replace the function of water in the normal sluice

## How I built a recirculating sluice box for gold prospecting
I drew up a simple plan for a cradle that would sit on top of a plastic storage bin full of water. The cradle would hold the sluice and allow me to adjust the angle of tilt. Water would be pumped out of the bin to the top of the sluice. Water and debris would fall back into the bin at the bottom of the sluice.

## DryWashers for Gold Gold Fever Prospecting
Gold Dry Washers are used primarily in areas where water is not available, such as arid and desert areas.
