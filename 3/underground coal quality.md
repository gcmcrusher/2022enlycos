Groundwater sampling and analysis have been carried out at the site of an underground coal gasification experiment conducted by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory near Gillette, Wyoming. Water from more than 12 wells in the vicinity of the experiment has been sampled before, during, and up to 10 months following gasification.

The Pocahontas No. 3 coal seam in southern West Virginia has been extensively mined by underground methods since the 1880's. An extensive network of abandoned mine entries in the Pocahontas No. 3 has since filled with goodquality water, which is pumped from wells or springs discharging from mine portals (adits), and used as a source of water for public supplies.

Coal gasification is a promising option for the future use of coal. Similarly to gasification in industrial reactors, underground coal gasification (UCG) produces syngas, which can be used for power generation or for the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels and other valuable chemical products. As compared with conventional mining and surface gasification, UCG promises lower capital
