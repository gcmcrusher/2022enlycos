Coking coals are converted to coke in byproduct coke oven batteries. The coking process consists of heating the blend of the crushed coking coals in the absence of air to drive off the volatile compounds. The resulting coke is a hard, but porous carbon material which is used for the reduction of iron bearing materials in a blast furnace.

How a Coke Plant Works. Coal is the main ingredient used to make coke. Iron is produced by inputting coal into a blast furnace. However, coal cannot be put directly into a blast furnace because of all the harmful byproducts that come from that. So, there is an intermediate process that occurs. Coal is converted into coke first.
