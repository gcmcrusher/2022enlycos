Gypsum is calcined by contacting it with the hot gases spewing out of a combustion tube submerged in the mass of gypsum. The formation of deadburned anhydrite is reduced by surrounding the combustion tube with a second tube called a draft tube.Gypsum passing through the annulus between the tubes is heated by the hot gases and is ejected from the annulus to prevent repeated excursions into the
