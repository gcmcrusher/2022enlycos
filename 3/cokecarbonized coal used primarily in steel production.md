Steel is an alloy consisting primarily of iron and less than 2% carbon. Iron ore is, therefore, essential for steel production, which is essential in maintaining a strong industrial base. 98% of mined iron ore is used to make steel. Iron is one of the most abundant metallic elements. Its oxides, or ores, make up about 5% of the earth's crust.

Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semihard cokingcoal, semisoft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of nearpure carbon

Global steel production is dependent on coal. Steel is an alloy based primarily on iron. As iron occurs only as iron oxides in the earth's crust, the ores must be converted, or reduced, using carbon. The primary source of this carbon is coking coal. Nearly all of the coke produced in the world is fed into blast furnaces to make steel. World

Steel production is an energyintensive process as it requires high temperatures to transform iron ore into steel. The energy and heat from the processes come from fossil fuels, which is primarily coal. The use of fossil fuels means that the average CO2 emissions from steel production is about 1.85 tonnes CO2 per tonne of steel produced.

Production of Steel. In the steel industry, coal is used indirectly to make steel. What happens here is that coal is baked in furnaces to form coal coke. Once this is formed, manufacturers use coal coke to smelt iron ore into iron and make steel. However, these chemicals produced from coal are used primarily to make other products. Besides,

Process of carbonization of coal. The coal to coke transformation takes place as the coal is heated. When the state of fusing is reached, the layer of heated coal softens and fuses.

## How steelmaking may go carbonfree—by dropping its addiction to coal
The furnaces that transform raw iron ore into finished steel consume vast amounts of coal, making the steel industry a major producer of carbon emissions. But new manufacturing methods—including biochar, hydrogenbased technologies, and "molten oxide electrolysis," to name just a few—may mean that a lot less coal will be burned in the future.
