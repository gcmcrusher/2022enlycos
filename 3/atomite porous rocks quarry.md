Permeability. For groundwater to be able to get into a rock with good porosity it must also have good permeability. For a rock to be permeable and for water to move through it, the pore spaces between the grains in the rock must be connected. Permeability is therefore a measure of the ability of water to move through a rock.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel grarock

This explains the need to use solid, nonporous rocks in heavyduty construction projects.
