Peter A. Claisse, in Civil Engineering Materials, 2016 17.9 Environmental impact. Cement production is one of the largest industries in the world. Annual world production in 2013 was approximately 4 GT (of which, about half was in China). It is produced in kilns at around 1400 o C (2500 o F), and approximately 750 kg (1650 lb) of CO 2 are released for each tonne (2205 lb.) that is made.
