Description. Mica is a mineral name given to a group of minerals that are physically and chemically similar. They are all silicate minerals, known as sheet silicates because they form in distinct layers. Micas are fairly light and relatively soft, and the sheets and flakes of mica are flexible. Mica is heatresistant and does not conduct

Biotite is a very common form of mica. It is named in honor Jean Baptiste Biot (1774 1862), a French physicist, mathematician, and astronomer who researched the mica minerals for their optical properties. Because of Biotite's abundance, its presence is usually lacking in collections except for it being an accessory mineral to other minerals.
