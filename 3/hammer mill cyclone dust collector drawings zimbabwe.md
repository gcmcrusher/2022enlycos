Cut a 20″ circle from your ¾" plywood. Using the router, cut a circular dado that is ¾" wide and ½" deep. The idea is to create a slot for the lip of the trash can to fit inside. Using the 20gallon Rubbermaid can, the inner diameter should be 18″. From the 20″ circle, cut out a 16″ diameter circle from the middle.

## Cyclone Separator Working Principle (Dust Separator) saVRee
Saw mills generate a lot of dust which must be extracted from the mill. Dust is drawn into the main extraction system by a negative pressure created by a fan usually a centrifugal fan. The dust laden air then passes through a cyclone separator where most of the wood dust is separated from the air stream; the clean air is then discharged
