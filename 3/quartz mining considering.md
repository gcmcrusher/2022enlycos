## Is Quartz Sustainable? An Honest Look at the Facts
Quartz, therefore, is a nice compromise. It has the look of stone, but it functions much more like a solid surface. In fact, quartz is nearly indestructible. It is not prone to cracking or scratching. Moreover, the surface is not porous like natural stone. Therefore, it will not stain, and it is very easy to clean.

Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. As a mineral name, quartz refers to a specific chemical compound (silicon dioxide, or silica, SiO 2 ), having a specific crystalline form (hexagonal). It is found is all forms of rock: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. Quartz is physically and chemically resistant to weathering.
