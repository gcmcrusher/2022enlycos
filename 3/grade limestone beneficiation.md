The chemical composition, mineralogy and homogeneity depend upon the provenance and depositional environment of a limestone deposit. Silica (SiO 2), Magnesia (MgO), Chloride (Cl), Iron (Fe 2 O 3), Sulphide (SO 3) are common deleterious constituents of limestone. The most common impurities associated with limestone deposits are clay and shale.
