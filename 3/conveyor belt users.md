A troughed belt is one of the most commonly used conveyors in industrial and mining practices. It gets its name from the troughshaped idlers that sit underneath the flat belt. The curved shape of the idlers means that the materials traveling on the conveyor are less likely to fall off the track and be damaged, destroyed, or lost.
