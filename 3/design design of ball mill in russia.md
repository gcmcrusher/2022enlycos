involve grinding). With Lloyd's ball milling book having sold over 2000 copies, there are probably over 1000 home built ball mills operating in just America alone. This article borrows from Lloyd's research, which was obtained from the commercial ball milling industry, and explains some of the key design criteria for making your own ball mill.

1) Overload in overflow ball mills is due to the approach to a critical axial flow velocity for pulp of 0.072 m/s. 2) While so far important only with 5.0 and 5.5 m diameter mills, it should be found with smaller mills in combinations of very high circulating loads, excessive L/D ratios, very soft ores or coarse grinds. 3. A proper balancing of lower Lf and higher F values can reduce the risk

The Selection and Design of Mill Liners MillTraj. Figure 5. High–low wave ball mill liner Materials The selection of the material of construction is a function of the application, abrasivity of ore, size of mill, corrosion environment, size of balls, mill speed, etc. liner design and material of construction are integral and cannot be chosen in isolation.

You also need a rod mill work index to design a ball mill operating on a coarse feed, above about 4 mm. Q1: You design for a typical percentage of critical speed, usually 75% of critical. Then you iterate the mill diameter using a Morrell Cmodel or Nordberg equation to get the RPM that corresponds to 75% for that mill diameter.
