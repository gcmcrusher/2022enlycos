RoboClam is a biomimetic burrowing robot that imitates the valve expansion/contraction digging pattern of the Atlantic razor clam, Ensis directus, to dig into submerged soil using an order of magnitude less energy than would be required to push into the soil with brute force.This paper examines whether it would theoretically be possible to use the same method to dig into dry soil.

Robot digger RoboClam (here and below the image Institute of Physics). The main feature RoboClam – the ability to dig into the high efficiency muddy or sandy ground. This machine mimics the Atlantic clams (Ensis directus) – bivalves, having a narrow elongated shell length from 9 to 13 cm

In addition to anchoring underwater vehicles and detonating mines, the RoboClam could also be used to lay underwater cables, Winter says. Companies that lay transAtlantic cables traditionally use a ship to drag a sled along the bottom of the ocean to dig a trough, lay the cable, and cover it over.

The researchers, who've been working on RoboClam since 2006, describe the mechanics behind this process in a paper to be published in Bioinspiration and Biomimetics. In use, RoboClam could be used to dig itself into the ground to bury anchors or destroy underwater mines, claimed its developer, Amos Winter, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering

When researchers compared the digging efficiency of the clam to commercial digging devices like anchors, it found that it was 10 times as efficient at digging as the machines on the market.

Using RoboClam, an E. directusinspired robot that learns to dig efficiently using a genetic algorithm (GA), we demonstrate that a machine can achieve comparable digging performance to the animal, with borrowing energy scaling linearly with depth in an idealized granular substrate and E. directus' habitat—cohesive mudflat soil. These
