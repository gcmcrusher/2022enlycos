Ball Milling. Cellulose materials were wet ballmilled with a PQN2 planetary ball mill (Livingston, NJ, USA). The enzymatically treated fibers were diluted to 1.0 wt% and then agitated by a mechanical blender for 10 min. Then 150 g of the diluted fibril slurry were put into an agate jar of 500 mL capacity.

Wet Ball Mills are Ball Mills that are used widely in the ore beneficiation industry,as well as the building material industry such as glass.. During the producing phase, the material and water are mixed together to grind in the ball mill. Under the effect of the flowing water,the material will get a better flow ability so the processing capacity will be higher.
