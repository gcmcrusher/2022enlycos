Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

The grinding of the finished cement consumes approximately one third of the total electrical energy of a cement plant. Vertical roller mills (VRM) have a higher energy efficiency than ball mills, even if the ball mill is combined with a roller press. This and further arguments led to the increased share of VRM for the grinding of finished cement.

## Energy efficiency of cement finish grinding in a dry batch ball mill
Energy utilization versus specific energy for batch grinding of (2–1.4 mm) cement with 20 mm ball diameter. Other experiments using crude cement clinker (Table 1) were conducted with an average composite ball size of 25.8 mm ( q = 2.5). The results of fineness versus specific energy using additional compounds are shown in Fig. 3.
