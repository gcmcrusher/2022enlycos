Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

The grinding of the finished cement consumes approximately one third of the total electrical energy of a cement plant. Vertical roller mills (VRM) have a higher energy efficiency than ball mills, even if the ball mill is combined with a roller press. This and further arguments led to the increased share of VRM for the grinding of finished cement.

## Energy efficiency of cement finish grinding in a dry batch ball mill
Energy utilization versus specific energy for batch grinding of (2â1.4 mm) cement with 20 mm ball diameter. Other experiments using crude cement clinker (Table 1) were conducted with an average composite ball size of 25.8 mm ( q = 2.5). The results of fineness versus specific energy using additional compounds are shown in Fig. 3.
