## Shale: Identification, Characteristics, and More Rockhound Resource
Shale is most commonly used for the extraction of clay for use in cement, pottery, tile, and bricks. It also has enormous economic value for the oil and gas industry as a target for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Shale is a common source rock for oil and gas due to its high organic content.
