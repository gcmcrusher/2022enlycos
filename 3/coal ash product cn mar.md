## Fly ash going global opens up a new way of resource utilization
Fly ash is one of China's largest industrial solid wastes and China is the largest producer of fly ash in the world. Fly ash refers to the fine fly ash and slag obtained from the flue gas collected by dust collector in coalfired power plants and power plants with comprehensive utilization of coal gangue and slime resources.

Significance. Coal combustion releases CO 2 but also leaves behind solid waste, or fly ash, which contains considerable amounts of carbon. The organic carbon sourced from fly ash resists chemical breakdown, and we find that it now contributes nearly half of the fossil organic carbon exported by the Chang Jiang—the largest river in Asia.
