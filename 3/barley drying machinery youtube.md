Drying wheat and barley. If you harvest grain at high moisture content, you need to artificially dry it to 13 to 14 percent moisture for safe storage. Crop producers sometimes harvest wetterthanusual grain to reduce harvest losses or because of wet weather. Dryers that use no heat (naturalair dryers) or very little heat (lowtemperature dryers).

Barley is similar to wheat. You need a grain header for harvesting it. You can get straw from it. It is used in the production of flour in a grain mill (150l of barley > 120l of flour). You can use flour to bake a Cake or Bread. You can feed it to the chickens. You can feed it to pigs. The yield of barley is 19,000l per hectare.

Steeping. The first step of malting is seeping. The concept is very much like how you water a seed to let it grow. Seeping is necessary to provide hydration to the barley seed to start the growing process. Steeping will usually last for 2 days, where the moisture content is raised to an average level of 45 percent.

Hulled barley takes quite a while to cook, upwards of one hour per cup in 3 to 4 cups of liquid. Presoaking for several hours is recommended, and the soaked barley may be cooked in the same soaking water. Pearl barley needs no presoaking and usually cooks within 30 to 45 minutes. Quick barley will cook in 10 to 12 minutes.
