With the help of machinery and explosives, openpit mining is three to five times faster than deepshaft mining. It is estimated that as much as 20,000 tons can be mined in one day. Despite its expedient extractive nature, openpit mining has severe environmental impacts. Evidence of the environmental impacts of openpit mining is overwhelming.

Also, bauxite mining severely affects the water retention capability of the soil.

However, due to the enlargement of the surface area after mining, and the extraction of much bauxite, the soil is less capable of

Bauxite mining often happens near farms and residential areas because bauxitebearing soil can also be fertile.

## The Environmental Impact of Aluminum (And Why it's Still Better Than 
Bauxite is collected from the ground in an openpit mining operation. It doesn't sit very deeply in the earth's crust, so some energy can be saved on drilling. However, to recover all the aluminum in an area, swaths of land must be bulldozed to reveal the dirt and ore underneath. Once collected, the bauxite ore has to be refined

Open pit mining. While Sangarédi was the orebody on which CBG's operations were founded, today between 85% and 90% of its output of raw bauxite comes from the Bidikoum and Silidara pits. After stripping any thin overburden, the ore is blasted and then loaded using hydraulic excavators into haul trucks for transport to the mine stockpiles.

Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

After mining, bauxite is refined into alumina, which is then converted into aluminum. Therefore, aluminum typically goes from ore to metal in three stages. Stage 1: Mining Bauxite.

Openpit panel mining has been the normal surface method since the early 1960s. A strip or block of bauxite is exposed and mined, and then another panel is exposed. The first panel is normally refilled with waste rock. Several panels typically were open at the same time to supply the proper blend of ores to meet mill specifications.
