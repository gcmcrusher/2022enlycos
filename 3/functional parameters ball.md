## Are there guidelines on how many parameters a function should accept?
Parameters belong to a level of abstraction which is different from that of the function. This means the reader of your code will have to think about the nature and the purpose of the parameters of your functions: this thinking is "lower level" than that of the name and the purpose of their corresponding functions.

## Functional Programming in Java with Examples GeeksforGeeks
Higherorder functions: In functional programming, functions are to be considered as firstclass citizens. That is, so far in the legacy style of coding, we can do below stuff with objects. We can pass objects to a function. We can create objects within function. We can return objects from a function. We can pass a function to a function.

## JavaScript Function Parameters W3Schools
The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value. Changes to arguments are not visible (reflected) outside the function.
