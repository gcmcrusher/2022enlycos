## How many tons are in a yard of gravel, sand, rock, topsoil & dirt
In this regard, "how many tons in a yard of gravel?", it's depends on wet and moist condition and density of gravel, for estimating purpose, generally a cubic yard of gravel weighs around 3000 pounds and 1 ton or tonne is equal to 2000 pounds, so number of tons in a yard of gravel such as 3000/ 2000 = 1.5 tons, hence there are 1.5 tonnes or tons in a yard of gravel.
