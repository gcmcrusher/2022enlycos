Most coal requires some preparation before use. Preparation may range from simply crushing to provide a size consist suitable for certain types of boilers to extensive size reduction and cleaning to remove sulfur and ashforming mineral matter. At present, coal cleaning is accomplished through physical separation of particles low in mineral

## Coal Preparation and Geostatistics SpringerLink
Recently interest has developed in combining geostatistics and coal preparation plant simulation to predict clean coal qualities (Armstrong et al. 1989). The basic concept is that geostatistics would provide statistically realistic models of recovery, ash content, sulfur content, etc. of the coal deposit for each washing (separation) density.

Coal beneficiation plants use a variety of equipment to separate the lighter coal from the heavier rock and clayey materials and heavy media cyclones, jigs, tromp vessels, hydrocyclones, tables, and froth flotation are common. After the coal and waste material are separated, various cleaning, waterremoval, and clarifying processes (e.g.. 47
