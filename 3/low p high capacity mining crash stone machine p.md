## Factor Of Safety: Factor of safety formula, definition  RiansClub
Factor Of Safety = Yield Stress / Working Stress. If the factor of safety is 1, then it means that the design load is equal to the safety load. So for a better design, the factor of safety should be always greater than 1. If the safety of factor is less than 1, then the product is in the danger zone.
