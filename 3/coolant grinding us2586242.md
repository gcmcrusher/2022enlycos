## wacky idea? radiator coolant for grinding Practical Machinist
143. Hi RC99, You allready know the answer but had to ask. If you are talking about modern radiator coolant the answer is NO! Ingesting it can ge lethal. Breathing it is just a bad idea. You may be thinking about coolant used many years ago. I recall my father talking about soluble oil used in radiators. Lost.
