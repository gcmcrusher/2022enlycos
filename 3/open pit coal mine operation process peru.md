## Employee Safety at Open Pit Mines in Peru, Tanzania, the Dominican 
(Peru) Miners are killed when lightning explodes methane gas inside a subsurface mine. A comprehensive approach to lightning safety is absent. (Many hundreds of deaths in coal mines in China, Russia, & USA.) Four of eight gas turbine generators suffer lightninginduced failures. Production losses at the mine are $600,000/day.

The open pit is opening the orebody from the surface by separate removal of ore and associated waste rocks. It is the most economic option for a deposit up to that depth where the economic ratio of ore and waste can sustain. There are many advantages in openpit mining method namely:Full visualization of exposed orebody and negligible ore loss,

Openpit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Openpit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

Openpit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface, maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel, allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.
