Jaw crusher can reach the crushing ratio of 46 and the shape of final product is even. They are widely applied to crush high hardness, mid hardness and soft rocks and ores such as slags, construction materials, marble, etc. The pressure resistance strength is under 350Mpa, that is, suitable for primary crush. Jaw Crusher can be used in mining

Gyrating or cone crusher: It uses a repeated compression action with fixed and moving crushing members. This kind of crusher produces less than 20% fines, and the aggregates are rather of cubic form. • Roller crusher: This crusher is composed of two cylinders rotating in opposite directions around two parallel axes. • Rotary bottom crusher.
