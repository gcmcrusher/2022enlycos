The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.
