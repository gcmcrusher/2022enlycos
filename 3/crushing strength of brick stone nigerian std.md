The crushing strength of stones varies in the range of 15100 N/mm 2. Transverse Strength Test (IS: 1121 (Part II)): To test stone for transverse strength, specimen pieces are made in the form of blocks 200 × 50 × 50 mm. These are tested in saturated and dry conditions similar to as explained in the compressive strength test.

This paper studied the effect of aggregate properties on the crushing strength of concrete. In order to achieve the study objective, three types of coarse aggregates, brick khoa, shingles stone, and black stone were used to test. And the test results show that concrete made from black stone has the highest workability followed by shingles stone & brick khoa of aggregates.
