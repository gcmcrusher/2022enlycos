For copper oxide ore, electrowinning is the final stage in the process of hydrometallurgy, in which concentrated copper solution from the heap leaching and solvent extraction processes is used as an electrolyte; an electric current is applied through an inert anode, resulting in the plating of copper onto 99.9% pure copper cathodes.

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.150.2mm.
