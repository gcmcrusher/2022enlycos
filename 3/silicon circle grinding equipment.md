Grinding is a process for making boardshaped workpieces thin (approx. less than 1 mm thick) and flat by using a grinding wheel. The grinding wheel is an abrasive which uses synthetic diamond. Wheel segments (thickness: several millimeters, height: 3 – 5 mm) are arranged along a ringshaped wheel base. There are various types of grinding

With a 2000 grit grinding process, the stress required to break the die was 50 percent higher than the stress needed to break a die with a (larger) 1200 grit grinding process. Figure 2 shows the method of applying the test force to the die, and Figure 3 shows the difference in the scratches on the wafers using different grits to grind the silicon.
