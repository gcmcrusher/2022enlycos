It must be at least 36 in. wide for an 18 x 36 jaw crusher. So a 4ft by 8ft screen would be acceptable. The 1in. screen is a second deck for the 38 tph from the jaw crusher, so the deck correction factor is 0.90 and that screen capacity is 2.1 x 0.9 = 1.89 tph/sq ft. The screen area needed under the jaw crusher is 38/1.89 = 20.1 sq ft.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle – StudiousGuy
A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces. The movement of the jaw crusher is
