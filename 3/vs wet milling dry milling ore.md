The mill can be fed from one end with the product removed from the other end or, alternatively, the mill can be fed from both ends with the discharge at the centre. The process can be wet or dry but generally it is carried out wet. Maximum rod length is about 6 to 7 meters, otherwise there is a risk of the rods bowing.

## Common & Basic Formulas for Mineral Processing Calculations
w = weight of dry ore (grams) in one liter of pulp, K = the solids constant, Assume the specific gravity of the water in the pulp to be unity. Formula (5) is used in making tabulations for mill use. As used in these formulas the specific gravity of the ore is obtained simply by weighing a liter of mill pulp, then drying and weighing the ore.

Grinding by wet vs dry in iron ore. grinding by wet vs dry in iron ore. An examination of the literature shows however that the actual difference between the results of wet and dry milling are often very large for example the power to drive a tube mill in which a given material is being wet ground may be as much as 30 less than that of a similar mill dry grinding As a leading global.

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.
