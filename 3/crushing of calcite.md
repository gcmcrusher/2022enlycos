## Calcite Processing by Flotation for Beneficiation
Crushing Calcite Ore: In the flowsheet a 2stage open circuit crushing section is provided to reduce the limerock to approximately minus ¾" for feed to the ball mill. The size of the crushing equipment depends largely upon the quarrying operation and the size of the largest pieces delivered to the crusher. This depends also on the mining
