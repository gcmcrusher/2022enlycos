## Sampling practice and theory Mine Engineer.Com
The values of "n" are a probability factor that attempts to associate the probability that any grain is the grain of value, in this case gold. The values of "d" are the diameter of the largest particle of ore to be sampled. I have found that it can be useful in sampling, when used by pesonnel that understand the ore, and sampling,

Accretionary orogens are the sites of longlived convergent margin tectonics, both compressional and extensional. They are also the hosts to the majority of the world's important gold deposits. A very diverse range of deposit types occurs within accretionary orogens, commonly in close proximity in space and time to each other. These include porphyry and associated highsulphidation Au–Cu

## Jewelry Metals 101: Gold, Silver, and Platinum
Metals commonly alloyed with gold for jewelry purposes include: silver, copper, nickel, iron, zinc, tin, manganese, cadmium, and titanium. In addition to enhancing gold's strength, alloying changes some of its other properties, too. For example, some gold alloys stain skin or cause allergic reactions.

## Flotation Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The FLOTATION PROCESS is one of the commonest methods of extracting the valuable minerals from certain classes of ores, and it is generally more efficient as regards the recovery of the minerals than any other process applicable to the treatment of similar types of ores. The metallic contents of the minerals are recovered from the concentrates in a subsequent series of metallurgical operations
