Artisanal processing of alluvial gold deposits: Small scale artisanal mining (i.e., not using "modern" technology) has been estimated to account for 15 to 20% of the world's nonfuel mineral production. The industry is highly labour intensive and employs 11.5 to 13 million people worldwide (Kafwembe and Veasey, 2001).

Most gold ore is processed, with the collected gold smelted to over 75% purity at or near the mine site. Gold is mainly separated from ore using the "carbon in pulp" process. Ore is crushed to a fine silt, then mixed with water and sodium cyanide to form a slurry. The gold reacts to form a gold cyanide complex which dissolves in the solution.
