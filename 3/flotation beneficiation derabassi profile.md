Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity (how much they are attracted to water) and is enhanced through the use of surfactants. Surfactants are chemicals that act as a wetting agent to attach to particles and increase their attractiveness to air bubbles.

4.1.2 Iron Ore Beneficiation Iron ore occurs naturally in a variety of forms, from sandlike iron fines to solid rock masses. Crude ore, or ore mined in the natural state, seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form of beneficiation. Crude ore is commonly mixed with other minerals (gangue), which reduce the iron content.
