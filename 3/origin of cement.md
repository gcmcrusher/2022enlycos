HISTORY OF CEMENT. The word "cement" is derived from the Latin word "caementum", which means chipped rock fragments. Limestone is well known to be the oldest material to be used as a binder. Lime was produced by heating near pure limestone, and lime mortar was created by adding and mixing water and sand. Concrete was first used in the

An Important Distinction: Cement vs. Concrete. Before delving into the history of concrete, there's one important misconception that needs to be cleared up first: Concrete is not the same thing as cement. Although the two words are often confused for each other, there's one main distinction: Cement is an ingredient in concrete.
