Wet flue gas desulfurization or scrubber systems are very effective in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions caused by coal combustion boilers. The flue gas discharged from the boiler is fed into the absorber, where a mixture of water and pulverized limestone is sprayed on the flue gas. The limestone slurry reduces sulfur emissions by absorbing the SO2 contained in the flue gas.

Postcombustion flue gas desulfurization and denitrification technologies are essential in achieving the full compliance of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) air quality standards by 2030 in China as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are the main precursors of PM2.5. Some studies have addressed the performance evaluation of desulfurization

Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) gypsum is generated as a byproduct for the desulfurization process, using limestone powder as an absorber in the coalfired power plants. The FGD gypsum is high in calcium sulfate concentrations and has few impurities. Its quality is not far behind compared to natural gypsum.
