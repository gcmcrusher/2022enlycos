The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns, and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is redissolved and removed from the carbon surface.

## Pregrobbing gold ores ScienceDirect
Pregrobbing is an important phenomenon that inhibits gold recovery due to the presence of naturally occurring carbonaceous matter. In case of certain ores, gold recovery by cyanidation is limited by the presence of naturally occurring carbonaceous material that adsorbs gold from alkaline cyanide solution unless steps are taken to prevent this adsorption reaction from occurring.
