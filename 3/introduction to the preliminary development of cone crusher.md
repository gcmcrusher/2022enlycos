## Research on the Wear Behavior of the Fixed Cone Liner of a Cone Crusher 
Taking reducing the wear of the fixed cone liner of a cone crusher as the starting point, the movement and geometry parameters of the cone crusher are studied using the discrete element method. To improve the service life and working efficiency of the whole cone crusher. The UG model and discrete element Yade model of the cone crusher are established, and the different shapes of the tin ore

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a Vbelt or direct drive.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
