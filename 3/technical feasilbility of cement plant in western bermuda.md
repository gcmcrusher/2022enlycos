## 14 Types of Technical Feasibility Simplicable
The following are common types of technical feasibility. Concepts Conducting a proof of concept to test an idea or approach. Infrastructure The capacity, performance characteristics and functionality of infrastructure. For example, a project may validate an assumption that a new system can use an organization's existing network infrastructure.
