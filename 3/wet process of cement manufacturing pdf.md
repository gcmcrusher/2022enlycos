Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart. (i) Drying Zones: In the wet process, the drying zone is comparatively larger than the dry process. It is because the raw material in slurry form is directly fed into the kiln which has more amount of water. As shown in the figure it is the upper portion of the kiln.

The kiln has to operate continuously in order to ensure a steady regime, and therefore uniformity of clinker. The larger existing kiln in a wet process plant produces 3600 tonnes of clinker per day. The manufacture of cement by wet process is energy intensive and thus uneconomical as compared to dry process and semi dry process.
