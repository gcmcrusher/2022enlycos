The following conclusions are drawn from the experimental investigations: 1. Quarry dust is the waste product which is used as better reinforcement for the A356 alloy. 2. Increasing in the weight percentage of the reinforcement in the alloy decreased the density value. 3. Composites fabricated using the stir casting process has obtained minimum

## An Experimental Study on Usage of Quarry Rock Dust as Partial 
In this paper, we have investigated the study of quarry rock dust as partial replacement of fine aggregate in concrete. Mix design has been developed for M20 grade using IS design for conventional concrete and replaced mix. Specimens on cubes, cylinders and beams were prepared for both conventional and 20%, 40%, 60% replacement with quarry dust.

## Quarry dust ScienceDirect
In an experimental study conducted by Kumar et al. (2020), quarry dust and foundry sand were utilized as fine aggregate for concrete. Based on the compressive strength results at 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days, it was established that the use of quarry dust & waste foundry sand at the proportion of 70:30 and 80:20 had enhanced the
