Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

## v117n8a13 Gold CIP and CIL process optimization in a capital  SciELO
The wellknown carboninpulp (CIP) and carboninleach (CIL) gold recovery processes are fairly robust. Considering the constantly changing characteristics of runofmine (ROM) ore, a robust process is in general a great advantage for a mineral processing plant. The disadvantage, however, is that because less input is required from operators and

## 50T/H Placer gold gravity separation process plant
Gold gravity separation is a beneficiation method. Gravity separation principle: It realizes the process of separating ore particles according to density according to different densities of various minerals and different gravity, fluid movement and other mechanical forces in moving media. Original gold ore is crushed into under 15mm by a jaw
