Synthesis of magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) was investigated by employing ball milling and coprecipitation methods. The starting materials (aluminum hydroxides) were obtained from the purified sodium hydroxide leaching solution of black dross. The characteristics of the synthesized spinel was analyzed through Xray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.
