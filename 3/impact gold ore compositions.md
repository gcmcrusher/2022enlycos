Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. It is a bright, slightly orangeyellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in a pure form. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element.It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under

## Gold: History of Use, Mining, Prospecting, Assay & Production Geology
For example, a gold nugget containing 885 parts of pure gold and 115 parts of other metals, such as silver and copper, would be considered 885fine. "Karat" indicates the proportion of solid gold in an alloy based on a total of 24 parts. Thus, 14karat (14K) gold indicates a composition of 14 parts of gold and 10 parts of other metals.

## Effect of the composition of some sulphide minerals on cyanidation and 
The two gold ores studied had very different compositions. The low sulphide ore had a low sulphide content (1.36% S), present as pyrrhotite while the second had a very high sulphide content (20.2% S), in the form of pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. The efficiency of the process conditions was peculiar to the ores.
