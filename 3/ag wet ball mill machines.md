## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid overgrinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.
