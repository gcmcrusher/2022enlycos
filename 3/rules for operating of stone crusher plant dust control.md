## Efficient Operating Rules Of Impact Crusher Need To Be Followed
Impact crusher crushes raw material by impacting energy. There are strong impact in the operation, which will produce dust. So, operators should pay attention to ventilation and dust collection to meet the requirements of environmental protection. Impact crusher is often used as secondary crushing equipment in the stone crushing plant.
