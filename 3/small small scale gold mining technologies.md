Smallscale mining accounts for 1015% of the worlds gold supply. Smallscale gold mining isn't really that small in reality. Workers employ a variety of methods and mining techniques. They pan for gold, dredge rivers, manually dig up ground with shovels, work with hydraulic systems, use mechanized crushers, and often utilize large earth

## Artisanal and SmallScale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and smallscale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with goldcontaining materials, forming a mercurygold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

Artisanal and smallscale mining (ASM) takes place under extreme conditions with a lack of occupational health and safety. As the demand for metals is increasing due in part to their extensive use in 'green technologies' for climate change mitigation, the negative environmental and occupational consequences of mining practices are disproportionately felt in low and middleincome countries.
