Grinding Cracks (part 2) The grind crack may not be so obvious to see visually because it will usually occur at right angles to the direction of the grinding pass and at right angles to the surface of the gear tooth. The depth of the crack is not known unless a crosssectional examination of the gear tooth is made.

## The Truth About Back Cracking and Grinding Spinehealth
The mechanisms that cause joints to crack or grind can differ from person to person. There are three primary theories about why facet joints crack, pop, or grind: Cracking the facet joints is known to provide temporary relief from low back stiffness or joint pressure. More research is needed to identify any longterm benefits of back cracking.

Crepitus or crepitation is the noise that may be heard during joint movements, such as a cracking, popping, snapping, or grinding. These sounds and sensations can occur in the neck as well. Most people at some point have experienced neck crepitus. One example is feeling a cracking sensation in the neck when turning the head to back up a car.

Evan Doran. Associate Editor. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove material. Each grain is its own miniature cutting tool, and as grains dull, they tear from the tool and make new, sharp grains prominent.
