## Hammer Crusher qxdali
Hammer crusher is mainly composed of rotor assembly, slug, shell, counterattack frame and drive parts. It mainly relies on the hammerhead of the crusher to strike the ore strongly in the upper chamber. The impact of the ore on the counterattack frame and the collision between the ores break the ore. The raw ore is fed into the crusher's inlet

## Reversible hammer crushers – Baioni Crushing Plants
Baioni MIL impact hammer crushers are designed for secondary or tertiary crushing of limestone materials, even with a compact consistency, of alluvial or quarry nature. The crushing operation is achieved through the impact of the masses at high speed. This involves a highspeed endless rotation which ensures that the material to be crushed
