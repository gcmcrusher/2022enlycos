## Hydrocyclone Working Principle Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The third type of classification used in mining is the Hydrocyclone, commonly called a Cyclone. Unlike the others it has no moving parts and is worked in conjunction of another piece of equipment, a pump. To understand the Hydrocyclone Working Principle we must first know its components. Beginning at the top, there is the OVERFLOW DISCHARGE.

the cyclone diameter. The cylindrical section is the next basic part of the cyclone and is located between the feed chamber and the conical section. It is the same diameter as the feed chamber and its function is to lengthen the cyclone and increase the retention time. For the basic cyclone, its length should be 100% of the cyclone diameter.

A cyclone is a device that uses centrifugal forces to classify solid particles, in a liquid stream, by size and/or density. What does a Cyclone do? If a cyclone is fed with a sand and water mixture containing a range of particle sizes, most of the fine sand will report to the overflow (the top of the cyclone), together with most of the water.
