In general terms, the abrasive grit size range for grinding wheels runs between 12 grit for rough grinding operations, such as those found in steel mills, and 220 grit for very fine/precision grinding operations. Again, there is no industry standard, but in general terms: Coarse grits run 12 to 24. Medium grits run 30 to 70.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? Norton
A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond, which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.

Fine Grinding (flat parts – single or doubleside) is the abrasive machining process for removing material using a bonded Superabrasive wheel at low speed with a liquid to keep the part cool. The fixed grain of a geometrically indefinable cutting shape acts like a plow (fig. 3) and material is removed by microgrooving /cutting (fig. 4).
