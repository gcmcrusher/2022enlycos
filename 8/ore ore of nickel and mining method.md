Mar 20, 2019 1 Description of nickel ore. The laterite nickel ore is complex in composition and can be roughly divided into two types: limonite type and silicon magnesiumnickel type. The main elements are nickel, cobalt and manganese. The laterite mining method generally uses openpit mining. The ore body generally does not require rock drilling or blasting.

The rise in nickel mining is attributed to the Kambalda region in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Nickel ore grades in the 1960s had 4% nickel but within a decade the nickel ore grade in Australia fell to 2%. Over the last 20 years, low grade laterite or sulphide deposits have posted an average ore grade of about 1.2%.

Copper Solvent Extraction. The separation of copper from nickel is based on the fact that there is an appreciable difference in the pH at which the two metals are extracted. Copper can be extracted, with very small amounts of nickel, at pH 6.0 to 6.5, while nickel is extracted from the copper raffinate at pH 8.0 to 8.2.
