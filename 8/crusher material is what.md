## What Is a Jaw Crusher? Here's How It Works Cutting Technologies
All jaw crushers will have one fixed jaw and a moving one. These two form a Vshaped chamber, where the materials are fed. The movable jaw will move back and forth against the fixed one, compressing all materials in the space between. The mobile jaw's movement will not be fixed from sidetoside. Instead, it moves in an elliptical motion with

## What Is Impact CrusherWorking Principle, Parts And Types
Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the highspeed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again. This process is repeated until the material is

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
