Figure is multiplied by the sq. footage of the screen deck. • Calculation gives the basic capacity of each deck and the total capacity of the vibrating screen. • The vibrating screen capacity is determined: • Using a standard sizing formula (9 variables). • Basic capacity of each deck opening. • Unique factors of that application. •

## SCREEN CAPACITY CALCULATION Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
VIBRATING SCREEN – CAPACITY CALCULATIONS Throughput per square foot of screen area is the name of the screen game, and no design engineer wants to be considered short in the area of capacity and efficiency. It behooves the buyer/operator to examine and evaluate the data available before committing to any screen type or system.
