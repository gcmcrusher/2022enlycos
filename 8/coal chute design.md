The conveyor main frame consists of a reworked Joy 14 BU1041CH loader provided by Peabody Coal Company for use during the test program. This machine has a 38inch wide conveyor belt and a 2Â½ inch pitch x 3 inch flight chain. The following modifications were made to the loader. (See Drawing No. 11484 and Figure 5.)

## Top 3 mistakes I've seen with chute designs Jenike & Johanson
Here's a the top three mistakes I see that can easily be avoided: Sticky material impacting in chute head box. Placing the head pulley of the incoming belt in a high velocity transfer directly above the receiving pulley. It makes a lot of sense to a 2d designer to place the end of the head pulley directly above the receiving belt.

It is 6 feet wide and opens the whole width. That means at least an 8 foot chute, which means a 40degree angle would put the end of the chute at least 6 feet off the ground. That's too high. I may have to just 'help' the coal down the chute with a shovel. Sounds like some work ahead of me for 4 tons.
