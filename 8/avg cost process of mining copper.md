## Copper Processing Multotec
Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through openpit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.
