Minerals can also act as a substrate onto which the solid pesticide is adhered. Aesthetic and practical concerns require that dry products be free flowing and nonclumping. While a mineral ordinarily used as a carrier or diluent sometimes suffice, more usually the formulator must resort to a mineral that has been chemically derivatized.
