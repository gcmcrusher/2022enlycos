With the infeed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.
