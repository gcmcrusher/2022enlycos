Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
