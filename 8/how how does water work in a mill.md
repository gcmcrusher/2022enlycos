The water pumping windmill is a simple, efficient design. The blades, also known as sails, of the windmill wheel catch the wind which turns the rotor. The wheel assembly is attached to a hub assembly by long arms. The hub assembly drives a geared mechanism that converts rotary motion to an upanddown motion.

## Watermill Wikipedia
A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower.It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering.Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. These watermills may comprise gristmills, sawmills, paper mills

## What does a grist mill do? How do old grist mills work? TheSmokies
How did old grist mills work? A grist mill uses hydropower. It takes water from a mill creek or river and runs it through a sluice to the top of a large wheel outfitted with a series of buckets that capture the water. Then, gravity pulls the heavier buckets down and water is dumped and the wheel spins.

The key component in a water mill was a waterwheel, although in later times turbines were also employed, which converted the kinetic and potential energy of water into rotational mechanical energy to drive various machines. Most commonly the mill would grind grain to produce flour. Historically there have been different types of water mill

Most sawmills use machines like mechanical ring cutters to strip each log of its bark. Others use waterjet blasters. Whatever method they employ, sawmills keep the bark waste to use as landscaping mulch or to fuel the kilns. In the debarking stage, a circular saw will buck or crosscut logs into the correct lengths.

The tub wheel could only work where the water flowed regularly throughout the year, and needed at least an eightfoot fall. In 1646, on the Saugus River, Massachusetts built an iron mill, complete with wateractivated triphammers, blast furnace, bellows, rollers, and slitters. By 1700 there were few New England villages without a watermill.
