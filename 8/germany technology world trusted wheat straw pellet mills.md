the roundwood with bark used for making pellets ranged from 15 to 95 years. Poplar and wheat straw samples were milled in a ZM200 rotor mill (Retsch GmbH, Germany) whereas pellets were comminuted in a LM 23.2 D horizontal roller mill (Loesche GmbH, Germany). All samples were milled to 0.5 mm. Biomass samples

## A Comprehensive Investigation on the Effects of Biomass Particle Size 
It was found that all these variables significantly affected the pellet density, the only exception being that no significant effect was observed regarding particle size on wheat straw pellet density. Three particle sizes, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2, were produced on a hammer mill, and smaller particles (except wheat straw) produced denser pellets.
