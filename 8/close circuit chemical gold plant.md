Gold grade of the cyclone underflow is determined to be 56.79 g/t. It can be seen from Table 1 that about 67.27 % of total gold content of cyclone underflow material is below 75 microns showing that the most of the gold particles in the circulating load is in 0/75 micron fraction. The gold grade of this size fraction is about 244.48 g/t.
