Gold was also mined at many beaches throughout Washington. Very small amounts of gold can be prospected from just about anywhere in the state, but certain areas are much richer than others. Some historic mining took place along the beaches during the early days, but very few of these mines lasted for very long. Interestingly, in some places there is platinum as well as gold.
