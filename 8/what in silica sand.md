## Silica – the Most Abundant Element in Sand and Soil
After oxygen, silica is the most abundant element in sand and soil, and is found mostly as silicon dioxide. Part 1. In the soil, it helps seeds to germinate by breaking through their hard outer shell and, if soil lacks silica, very few seeds would sprout naturally. In biodynamics it is recognised as an essential mineral and is added to composts.

To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand–lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.
