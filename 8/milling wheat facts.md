To meet demand, the UK flour milling industry processes 6.2 million tonnes of wheat to produce almost 5 million tonnes of flour every year. The industry is the largest single processor of British wheat. In 2019/20 the proportion of homegrown wheat used by flour millers was 87% equalling the alltime high previously seen in 2011.

Wheats are then blended before milling to achieve the quality of flour required. This process is called Gristing. Water is added to the wheat in small amounts to ensure easy separation of the bran (outer coating) from the endosperm (inner part of the wheat). The water helps to toughen the outer bran layers and softens the inner portion.
