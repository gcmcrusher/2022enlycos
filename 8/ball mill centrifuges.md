The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed", and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed. Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed

High Energy Ball Mill. Ball Mill is a grinder that blends or grinds materials for various applications. Impact force enables size reduction in feed material. The cylindrical shell rotates around its horizontal axis. The main element enabling grinding is the hard and small balls in the ball mill. These balls are usually made of steel.
