Some locations, even some service stations, actually, have coolant recycling machines that remove glycol from the old antifreeze. They then add some additives to the mixture and are able to make reusable antifreeze. Note that this process only works if the antifreeze is old and pure, not if it has been tainted with metals or other materials.

Most recycled antifreeze is put back to use treatment as antifreeze. Automotive shops can recycle it on site using specialized machinery. The machines remove the heavy metals and any oil that has made its way into the liquid, and then add chemicals to keep the ethylene glycol from breaking down. There are several different processes for doing this.
