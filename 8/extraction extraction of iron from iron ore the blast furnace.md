Iron, when extracted from iron ore such as haematite containing iron (III) oxide, Fe2O3, in a blast furnace is called iron extraction blast furnace metallurgy. In this reduction reaction, oxygen is removed from the iron (III) oxide to leave behind iron. Generally, the extraction of metals and their isolation are based on three major procedures.

This is done in a blast furnace. The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide). Its formula is Fe 2 O 3. Haematite is added to the top of the furnace along with coke (i.e. carbon) and limestone. Three reactions take place during this extraction. Firstly, the carbon in the blast furnace burns with the hot air to form carbon
