The bond is the substance that causes the abrasive grains to adhere to the wheel. Bonds can consist of different materials. Common materials include shellac, resinoids, rubber and glass or glassceramic. At Weiler Abrasives, our portable grinding wheels contain resinoid bonds. The bond on a grinding wheel may be either hard or soft.

## What is the Optimal Speed for a Belt Grinder? Calculating SFPM Red 
The optimal speed for belt grinders is largely dependent on a number of factors, including type of abrasive grain, grit grade, workpiece material, and more. Generally speaking, a safe speed in most cases is 3,000 surface feet per minute. You can calculate surface feet per minute using the formula SFPM = RPM X .262 X Tool Diameter.
