## Froth Flotation Process Detailed Explanation With Diagrams  BYJUS
Froth flotation is an important concentration process that can be used to selectively separate hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic waste gangue. In a more simple context, froth flotation is one of the most popular operational processes for mineral beneficiation. In ore/mineral beneficiation, froth flotation is a method by which commercially

A more or less stable layer of froth is maintained on the surface of the slurry. Particles that are attached to bubbles will tend to remain attached at airwater interfaces when the bubble enters the froth layer. Particles that are retained in the froth are recovered at the lip of the froth weir at the edge of the flotation cell.
