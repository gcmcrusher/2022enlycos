## Natural Graphite Superior Graphite
Amorphous graphite is the lowest grade but most abundant of the three natural graphites. It makes up approximately half of the global natural graphite supply. If it were deposited directly from a fluid phase, as this theory holds, that would explain the veins of the graphite that are found in ore rock. In layman's terms, hightemperature

Graphite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ f aɪ t /) is a crystalline form of the element carbon.It consists of stacked layers of graphene.Graphite occurs naturally and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.Synthetic and natural graphite are consumed on large scale (300 kton/y ea, in 1989) for uses in pencils, lubricants, and electrodes.Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to

They are classified into microcrystalline graphite, macrocrystalline graphite and lump graphite based on the physical and chemical properties. Graphites are extracted by two techniques: the open pit method and the underground method. The economic value of the ore will determine the type of the mining to be used.
