HEA2® is one of the most effective dispersants yet developed for use as a grinding aid/pack set inhibitor for portland cement and other hydraulic cements. HEA2® greatly improves the efficiency of the grinding process by reducing the surface energy forces which cause agglomeration of the newly fractured cement particles. HEA2® is effective in both open circuit and closed circuit cement mills.

As a general rule, there should be less than 25% of clinker that is below 1mm in size. Coarse clinker is more of an issue for ball mills. Some cement groups use a formula, such as Bond's, to calculate the maximum ball size required in a ball mill, based on the average size of the clinker feed. However, one drawback with this approach is that
