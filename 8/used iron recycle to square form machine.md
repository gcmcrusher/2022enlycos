Watch on. Ductile iron—also referred to as spheroidal or nodular iron—is actually a group of irons that exhibit high strength, flexibility, durability, and elasticity due to their unique microstructure. Cast ductile iron normally contains over 3 percent carbon; it can be bent, twisted, or deformed without fracturing.

The hysteresis losses are considered to be related to the magnetic domains movement and rotation, as well as material grain's composition and size (Bastos and Sadowski, 2003).As shown in Figure 1.15, the curve of B–H forms a hysteresis cycle after the first magnetization. As the magnetic field B and H vary along this cycle periodically, the energy in device is consumed.
