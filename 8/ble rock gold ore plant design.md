Concentration means increasing the amount of gold in ore or sediment, by selectively removing lighter particles. If employed effectively, concentration methods can eliminate or greatly reduce the need for mercury. Before concentration can begin, ore must be crushed or milled to liberate gold particles from rock and to decrease grain size.

Crushing the ore can free the gold and allow recovery by gravitybased methods. In fact it's very common that the gold in hard rock ores will range in the 30 to 200mesh size range with most of the gold in the lower end of that range. The tried and true method for testing these ores in the field is hand crushing and panning.

Rhyolite. Rhyolite is a felsic (silicarich) volcanic igneous rock with the same mineral content as granite, only unlike granite, it cools fast from the molten rock near or over the surface of Earth's crust (extrusive type).When these magmas erupt, a rock with two grain sizes typically forms. The larger crystals that form just beneath the surface cool at a slower pace and are known as phenocrysts.
