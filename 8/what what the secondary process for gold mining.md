## Gold mining Wikipedia
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Gold Mining Process
The gold mining process is complex and goes beyond what most people imagine — miners in hard hats working underground or operating large, noisy mining equipment are images that often come to mind. However, the actual mining of gold ore is only one step in a complex gold mining process. Before miners can extract gold ore from the ground

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Source: jiangxivictor.en.madeinchina. The first step in gold smelting involves processing the gold ore. Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore.

## Gold Refining Step by Step Process: A Useful Discussion
Gold refining is a group of processes to pull out and set the precious metal apart from recycled elements (such as electronics and jewelry), mined materials, etc. The two most popular refining techniques to extract pure gold include the Wohlwill process and the Miller process.. Whereas the Miller process produces around 99.5% of pure gold, the Wohlwill process has managed to enhance the purity

At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bioleach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost

## Secondary exploration key to existing mining operations
A key driving force for secondary exploration is optimal extraction, i.e., mining cost effectively, especially at the country's gold mines. Van Schoor points out that it has become increasingly difficult to mine good ore grades as this requires companies to go deeper, thereby making operations more expensive and hazardous.

Step #9 – Mine reclamation. After a few years, gold reserves in the mine will be exhausted. In the old days, the mine would be boarded up and abandoned. Today though, a reclamation project is done to try and return the land to its previous natural state – as much as possible anyway. As you can see, the process of taking metal ore from the
