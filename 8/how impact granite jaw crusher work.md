Typically, jaw crushers produce less fine material than impact crushers. The reduction ratio of a jaw is approx. 4 to 1. Fines are necessary to meet certain gradations and increase material compaction. This is the reason why a jaw crusher is predominenatly used as a primary crusher for an intial reduction in size or to produce a nonspec material.
