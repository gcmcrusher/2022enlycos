With a share of about 70 per cent, the Miller process, patented in 1867, is the most widely used refining method for extracting fine gold from raw gold. In this chemical process, a stream of pure chlorine gas is blown through a crucible filled with molten but impure gold. The process purifies the gold to a degree of 99.999 per cent, as almost

Gold extracted by amalgamation or cyanidation contains a variety of impurities, including zinc, copper, silver, and iron. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process is based on the fact that virtually all the impurities present in gold combine with gaseous chlorine more readily than gold does at temperatures equal to or

The technology boom for developing pure gold continued with E.B. Miller's process of refining impure gold with chlorine gas (patented in Britain in 1867) and Emil Wohlwill's electrorefining process (introduced in Hamburg, Germany, in 1878). In fact, gold with purity of 99.99 percent is created using a combination of the processes.

The Miller process is typically used by largescale rather than smallscale refineries. Pyrometallurgical Process. This is a specialized gold refining process that is necessary if the unrefined gold contains copper. It also removes base metals but does not remove silver or PGMs, which is why it is not generally used by largescale refineries.
