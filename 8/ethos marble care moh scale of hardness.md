## Marble: Expectations StoneTrends
Marble, Travertine and Limestone are generally 23 on the Mohs scale while Granites are generally 56 and quartz products at 7. (Only Diamonds are rated at 10). For comparison, a typical steel steak knife is around 5.5 and cannot scratch granite but could scratch marble, travertine or limestone. The use of cutting boards will help this greatly.

## Mohs hardness Definition, Table, Examples, & Facts
Mohs hardness, rough measure of the resistance of a smooth surface to scratching or abrasion, expressed in terms of a scale devised (1812) by the German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs. The Mohs hardness of a mineral is determined by observing whether its surface is scratched by a substance of known or defined hardness. To give numerical values to this physical property, minerals are ranked along

Depending on type, garnet hardness ranges from 6.5 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale. For example, almandine, pyrope, spessartine, and tsavorite are on the harder side while demantoid is a bit softer. Garnets have fair to good toughness, making them durable enough for all jewelry styles as long as they are treated with the proper care.

Rapid or uneven heat can cause peridot to fracture. Peridot is stable to light but is easily attacked by sulfuric acid, and less easily by hydrochloric acid. It can also be attacked over a long period of time by acid perspiration. Warm, soapy water is the best method for cleaning peridot. Ultrasonic and steam cleaners are not recommended.
