Since the second quarter of 2016, when domestic coal production fell to a record low of 160.9 million tons, U.S. coal tonnage rebounded and held roughly flat. While exports are a relatively small part of the entire U.S. coal market, the temporary rise in demand increased opportunities for operators with access to the seaborne markets.
