Ceramics How do you assess a ceramic artifact and decide on its treatment? Material Characteristics. All ceramics are made of fired clay. Kaolinite (Al2O3.2SiO2.2H2O) is the most predominant clay mineral, but other minerals commonly found in clay are quartz (SiO2), feldspars, calcite (CaCO3), iron compounds such as iron oxide (Fe2O3), as well as other materials such as shell (CaCO3) and straw.
