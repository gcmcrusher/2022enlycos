## Copperbelt Wikipedia
The Copperbelt is a natural region in Central Africa which sits on the border region between northern Zambia and the southern Democratic Republic of Congo.It is known for copper mining.. Traditionally, the term Copperbelt includes the mining regions of Zambia's Copperbelt Province (notably the towns of Ndola, Kitwe, Chingola, Luanshya, and Mufulira in particular) and the Congo's HautKatanga

In recent years the concept of synsedimentary precipitation of copperiron(cobalt) sulphides for the stratiform deposits of the Zambian Copperbelt has become widely accepted by many Zambian based mine Geologists and others who have studied these deposits. However, recent work by the author has led him to hold very grave doubts on the ability of this theory to satisfactorily explain the facts.
