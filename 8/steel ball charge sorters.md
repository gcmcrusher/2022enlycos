The sorting of the ball charge can lead to significant energy savings of up to 5 %, because the efficient grinding of the particles is directly related to the gap spaces between the balls. If the gaps between the balls are too large, the material has to remain longer in the mill until it reaches the appropriate fineness.

To help the grinding process, water and steel balls are added to the process which then form the charge in the mill. Ball mill charge contains a significant amount of steel balls and can become extremely heavy.
