The grinding of the finished cement consumes approximately one third of the total electrical energy of a cement plant. Vertical roller mills (VRM) have a higher energy efficiency than ball mills, even if the ball mill is combined with a roller press. This and further arguments led to the increased share of VRM for the grinding of finished cement.
