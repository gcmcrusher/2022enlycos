The particle size is of particular importance in this process. If the particles are too large, unwanted accessory minerals cannot be separated from the ore. The ore concentrate obtained only has a low purity. Overgrinding, on the other hand, results in high milling costs and low throughput as well as an increased need for chemicals in flotation.

Importance of Microscopic Studies in Mineral Dressing. MINERAL dressing is primarily a process of separation of minerals by physical methods, involving little or no chemical change. A thorough understanding of the identity and texture of minerals present in an ore is, therefore, a prerequisite to any attempt to separate one mineral from the other.
