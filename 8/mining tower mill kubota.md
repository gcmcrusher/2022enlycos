The tower mill is characterised by a large, vertical doublehelical steel screw agitator, whereas the pin mill employs a vertical shaft with embedded sets of pins. The interaction between the agitator and charge generates motion within a media of steel or ceramic balls leading to size reduction of the feed that flows through between the media.
