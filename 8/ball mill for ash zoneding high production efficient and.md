## Applied Sciences Free FullText Preparation of Palm Oil Ash  MDPI
The interest in the utilization of palm oil ash is high, mainly due to their renewable material, opportunity to enhance the properties and possibility to use in a wide range of applications. Palm oil ash is the byproduct of the palm oil mill boilers and locally available in the form of microsize particles. In this research, optimization of the milling process was designed using the Taguchi

## Mechanical Treatment of MSWI Fly Ash: A Way Forward to Inhibit PCB 
Preparation and Ball Milling of MFA. Model fly ash (MFA) sample preparation and ball milling procedures have been described in detail in our previous work (Mubeen et al., 2017).Briefly, required materials were grinded together in a mortar for about 10 min in the following weight proportions: activated carbon (AC; 2.5 wt%), sodium chloride (NaCl; 10 wt% Cl), 0.2 wt% copper chloride (CuCl 2) was
