## Hawaii quits coal in bid to fight climate change
In 2020, Hawaii's Legislature passed a law banning the use of coal for energy production at the start of 2023. Hawaii has mandated a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and was the first state to set such a goal. Windmills and solar panels are shown in Kahuku, Hawaii on Monday, Aug. 22, 2022. As Hawaii transitions toward its goal of

Coal is a black or brownishblack sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity. It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel

## What is coal used for? U.S. Geological Survey
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coalfired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into highpressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

Coal is a solid, black, readily combustible fossil fuel that contains a large amount of carbonbased material approximately 50% of its weight. The formation of coal takes a significant amount of time (on the order of a few million years), and the first coalbearing rock units appeared about 290360 million years ago, at a time known as the Carboniferous or "coalbearing" Period.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

Etymology. The word originally took the form col in Old English, from ProtoGermanic kula(n), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the ProtoIndoEuropean root g(e)ulo"live coal". Germanic cognates include the Old Frisian kole, Middle Dutch cole, Dutch kool, Old High German chol, German Kohle and Old Norse kol, and the Irish word gual is also a cognate via the IndoEuropean root.
