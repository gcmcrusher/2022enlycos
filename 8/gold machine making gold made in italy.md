## How gold is made history, used, parts, procedure, industry, machine 
Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such as goblets.

Whether the country uses the karat system or a decimal/percentage system depends, but 10K, 12K, 14K, 18K are all common alloys of gold. Typically, someone doesn't know the exact composition of your piece. But a mark of 14K (or .585) will tell you that it's 58.5% gold. Putting these hallmarks on chains that don't have this gold content gets you

Since jewelry made in Italy may have the markage number, rather than the karat number, it is essential to know how karats correspond to markage. Siting sources like Gemologica can provide guidance.
