photon magnetic particle theory. The photons are particles with a minute but existant electro magnetic field around them. Waves are created when the photon fields from one slit interact with other fields of photons from the other streams exiting the other slits, and move the photons off their course. But with a single slit they are leaving the

## Recent developments in magnetic methods of material separation
A significant increase in the magnetic field gradient can be achieved by placing ferromagnetic bodies (such as balls, mesh or steel wool) into the magnetic field of a separator (Frantz, 1937).These bodies (usually called a matrix), generate, when magnetised, a high local field gradient of the magnitude as high as 5 × 10 4 T/m. This innovation extended considerably the range of the magnetic
