graphite is commercially called as amorphous graphite. The r.o.m ore Of low grade, containing about 10% fixed carbon (FC), has to be invariably beneficiated before marketing. Processes for graphite beneficiation depend upon the nature and association Of gangue minerals present. Graphite can be enriched easily by flotation because Of its natural

## Froth Stability an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Froth flotation technology has been widely used for the separation of graphite and metal oxides. Fenton reagent (0.1 mol L −1 FeSO 4, 0.1 mol L −1 H 2 O 2, and deionized water) has been reported to enhance the separation of LiCoO 2 from graphite up to 60%, while roasting can increase the flotation efficiency of LiCoO 2 up to 90% (Fig. 4 a).

Froth flotation is one of the most commonly used methods for the beneficiation of natural graphite resources [1,2,3,4].In graphite flotation, hydrophobic particles are selectively captured and transported by rising air bubbles, leaving hydrophilic gangue minerals in the suspension and discharging as tailings [].Therefore, bubble plays an indiscernible role in mineral flotation.

## Iron ore beneficiation technology and process
Iron ore beneficiation technology and process. 121720; 1,965 Views; icon 0; Iron ore is one of the important raw materials for the production of pig iron and steel in the iron and steel industry. There are many types of iron ore. According to the magnetic properties of the ore, it is mainly divided into strong magnetism and weak magnetism.

A majority of the studied graphite had a distinctly flakey (0.2–1 mm in length) or platy morphology with a wellordered crystal lattice. Beneficiation studies were performed to produce highpurity graphite concentrate, where rod milling and froth flotation produced a final concentrate of 90% fixed carbon with recoveries between 67% and 83%.

This invention concerns a method of beneficiating graphite to a higher purity level by dislodging the impurities from graphite by attrition preferably in an attrition cell which has at least one set of opposing pitched impellers. A pulp is formed preferably essentially consisting of a flake graphite:attrition adjuvant:water in a ratio of 1:2:0.8 to 10 and this pulp subjected to attrition in an

Graphite ore is metamorphosed by high pressure, and it is generally bluegray, and after weathering, it is yellowbrown or graywhite. According to the characteristics of scaly graphite ore deposits and the properties of ore, the purification methods are also different. The beneficiation methods of graphite ore mainly include flotation purification method, alkaline acid purification method
