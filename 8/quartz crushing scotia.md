This can be an indicator of gold. Iron Staining & Gossans: Not all veins produce much quartz – gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides – which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides. Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.

Quartz ore crushing. A jaw crusher is selected for crushing quartz stone to a particle size of about 150 mm. The advantages of the jaw crusher are large throughput and feeding size, simple and convenient maintenance, and low cost. Quartz stone is a material with higher hardness, so the cone crusher is the best choice in the secondstage crushing.
