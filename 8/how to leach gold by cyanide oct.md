## the use of cyanide in gold mining
· Liberation: Cyanide leaching will only be effective if the cyanide can come in contact with the gold particle. For this to happen, the ore should either be sufficiently porous for cyanide to reach the gold, or more usually the ore is crushed and ground to a size at which the surface of the gold is exposed – i.e. the gold is liberated.
