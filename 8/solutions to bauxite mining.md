## Flow Measurement of Sodium Hydroxide Solution in Bauxite  FLEXIM
Overview. After crushing and milling, the bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) at a temperature of 150 to 200 °C to extract the aluminium as a sodium aluminate solution. Flow control of the NaOH solution at such elevated temperatures is crucial. Conventional meters such as DP/Orifice

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

Bauxite is the primary source for aluminum (Al). Ores in this group include aluminum hydroxides, gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore. It is not just the concentration of aluminum that is important for bauxite mining, but also the identification of penalty elements such as iron oxide that may also make overall compositional analysis more challenging.
