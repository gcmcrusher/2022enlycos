A process for upgrading lowgrade magnetitecontaining iron ore with minimum fine grinding. The dry ore is first comminuted to between about threefourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.

The present study focuses on the mineralogical aspects and roasting of iron ore (Fe: 55.4%) fines in both fixed bed and fluidized bed roaster. Goethite is the dominant mineral phase in this lowgrade iron ore containing hematite, silica and alumina. Such ore was roasted at a constant temperature of 900°C, with noncoking coal of 20% at residence time ranging from 15 to 60 minutes at intervals

## What is iron ore beneficiation? Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel 
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
The reasons for choosing jigging for the iron ore beneficiation over other processes include (i) relatively easy separation, (ii) beneficial tradeoff between operating cost and reduced yield relative to dense medium processes, (iii) ability to treat ores requiring cut densities higher than a density of 4.0, and (iv) physical characteristics of
