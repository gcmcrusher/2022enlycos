The quarry was opened in 1741 as the first granite quarry in Scotland. Until 1971, a total of about 0.002 km ³ of rock were collected and sold in many regions, including those outside the United Kingdom. For example, the docks have been built in Southampton and Portsmouth with granite from the Rubislaw Quarry around the turn of the century.

## RUBISLAW QUARRY (Aberdeen) What to Know BEFORE You Go Tripadvisor
Rubislaw Quarry, which closed in 1971, supplied much of Aberdeen's granite. What remains is a very big hole, now (2013) almost full of water. The site is very hard to access, as it's adjacent to oil company offices on private roads and security fences and rampant undergrowth prevent anything but a glimpse of the site.

RUBISLAW QUARRY. My hometown of Aberdeen is known to Scotland as the Silver City, and it earned this title by quarrying Granite from what became one of the largest manmade holes in Europe. The stone stands impervious on every street and in every building, never ageing, it leaves the city to look the same as the day it came out of the ground.
