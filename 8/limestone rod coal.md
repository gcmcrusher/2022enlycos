## Coal and Limestone Handling SpringerLink
The coal handling facility is the lifeline of a coalfueled power plant. Modern plants have high coal demands because of the everincreasing sizes of turbine generator units and the economic advantages of a single coal (fuel) handling facility serving a multiunit power plant. Thus, coal handling facilities have had to become more flexible

Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are prevented by generous application of rock dust (usually limestone).
