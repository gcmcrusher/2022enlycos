Concentrates are made by crushing and then milling ore down to a particle size that permits copper to be released by flotation. Copper concentrations in concentrates from various places ranging from 24 percent to 36 percent. After that, the copper concentrates go through a final filtration and drying process to reduce the humidity to 89 percent.

Copper hydrometallurgy is a branch of metallurgy method to extract copper directly from those difficulttoconcentrate copper oxide ore. Traditional copper hydrometallurgy process typically consists of atmospheric leaching, solvent extraction (SX) and electrowinning (EW). It can produce either copper cathode or copper sulphate crystal.

Copper wire and cable, however, account for half of the world's copper production. Copper sulfide ores must be concentrated before they can be economically transported and smelted. The universal technique for this concentration is the froth flotation of finely ground ore. Copper concentrate is also used for producing blister copper.
