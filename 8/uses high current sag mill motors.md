A voltage sag (U.S. English) or voltage dip (British English) is a shortduration reduction in the voltage of an electric power distribution system. It can be caused by high current demand such as inrush current (starting of electric motors, transformers, heaters, power supplies) or fault current (overload or short circuit) elsewhere on the system.. Voltage sags are defined by their magnitude

Thus, the gear reduction ratio between the inching drive motor and the mill is roughly 12,000 to 1.

The duration of a voltage sag event, by definition, is less than 1 min and more than 8 msec, or a half cycle of 60Hz electrical power. RMS voltage variations include interruption, swell, and sag (Fig. 1.). An interruption is a complete loss of voltage, or a drop to less than 10% of nominal voltage in one or more phases.
