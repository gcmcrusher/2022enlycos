Using a pry bar and a good shovel, work loose the concentrates on the lower section. Check for coarse gold (nuggets). Make sure to also break up and pan out other sections of this gravel mass. These hardened sections occur in bands and there may be some very rich gold finds suspended in the upper gravel mass.

Most of the hydraulic mining operations which operated during the early to mid1900's were directed at high benches."Hydraulic mining" was done by directing a large volume of water, under great pressure, at a streambed to erode its gravels out of the bed and through recovery systems, where the gold would be trapped.

Prospecting bench gold placers. Gold bearing placer streams in Colorado are generally many thousands of years old, sometimes millions of years old. In that much time, a stream can move around and erode much deeper into a valley. As this happens, cobble deposits containing gold can be orphaned, or left behind, by the flowing water.

In 1880 a recorded amount of $1 million dollars was realized from the gold produced on the beach sand within the Orick District. It is also worth noting that in this area gold can also be recovered in terrace and bench gravels in the bluffs. A miner does not need to restrict their prospecting to the current beaches.
