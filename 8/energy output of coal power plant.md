## CoalFired Power Plant an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Coalfired power plants are the primary sources of coal FAs in the United States. According to the US Energy Information Administration, approximately 24% of the electricity generated in the United States relies on coalburning (Fig. 23.1).As of 2018, the generation of coal FA in the United States was over 36 million tons, and 20 million tons of it were recycled (ACAA, 2019).

## How to Calculate the Coal Quantity Used in a Power Plant
Coal trader's web sites give base prices in the international market. We take a coal price of around 65 $ / Ton. The cost of coal consumed by 100 MW power plant is (53.8 x 65) 3497 $ /hr. A 100 MW unit produces 100,000 units of electricity. So the cost of coal per unit of electricity is (3497/100,000) 3.5 cents per unit. Mechanical Engineering.
