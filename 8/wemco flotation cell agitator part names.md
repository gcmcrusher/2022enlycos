## Flotation Machine an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Probably the most significant area of change in mechanical flotation machine design has been the dramatic increase in machine size. This is typified by the data of Fig. 8, which shows the increase in machine (cell) volume size that has occurred with a commonly used cell manufactured by Wemco.The idea behind this approach is that as machine size increases, both plant capital and operating costs

## Productive froth flotation technology FLSmidth
The WEMCO rotor is located at top of the cell, and the nextSTEP rotor is placed at the bottom of the machine. The rotor placement creates different flow patterns within the cell, which affects froth recovery. When it comes to aeration of the cells, WEMCO machines draw in and use air without the use of an external blower.

Jun 22, 2015 Whatever flotation machine design is chosen, it must perform a series of complicated functions. Some of the more obvious are: Good mixing of pulp. To be effective, a flotation machine should maintain all particles uniformly in suspension within the pulp, including those of relatively high density anchor size.
