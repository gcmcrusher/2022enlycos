Certainly, xanthates break down in water at all pHs. But this breakdown has little to no effect on the residuals under typical flotation conditions. The time for xanthate breakdown in water at high pH is much longer (hours) compared to the time to react with the sulfide ore, which is on the order of minutes.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been applied to study the adsorption morphology of various collectors, i.e., potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) and potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and Cytec Aerofloat 238 (sodium dibutyl dithiophosphate), on chalcocite in situ in aqueous solutions. The AFM images show that all these collectors adsorb strongly on chalcocite. Xanthate adsorbs mainly in the form of
