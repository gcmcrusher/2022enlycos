How is chromium extracted? Chromium is generally extracted from its ores by oxidation in the form of chromate, in which state its valence is six.The product of this reaction is then treated to extract the chromate. In the present state of the art, the commonly used process for oxidation of chromium ores is known as oxidizing alkaline roasting.
