## The Theoretical Practices of Physics Oxford University Press
R.I.G Hughes presents a series of eight philosophical essays on the theoretical practices of physics. The first two essays examine these practices as they appear in physicists' treatises (e.g. Newton's Principia and Opticks) and journal articles (by Einstein, Bohm and Pines, Aharonov and Bohm). By treating these publications as texts, Hughes casts the philosopher of science in the role of critic.

Honors in physics, mathematics, or a field related to those subjects should be made part of a firstclass or strong upperclass undergraduate degree. It is common to require an integrated MPhys or MSci degree equivalent to that of a UK degree. An entry requirement of a bachelor's degree has at least four years of study duration.
