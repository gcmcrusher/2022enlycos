## Selfadaptive grinding for blind tip reconstruction of AFM diamond 
For hardness measurement of thin films, the diamond triangular pyramidal tip is recommended for its abrasive resistance, material stability and structural symmetry. However, because of its relatively large tip radius and half angle, the insitu topography of the residual indentation will be highly narrowed by the indenter.

In order to assure the integrity of brittle pyramidal arrays, a rough grinding process was first repeated with the depth of cut of 5 μm, and then a fine grinding process was repeated with the depth of cut of 1 μm to assure the Vtip sharpness. Detail micro grinding conditions are shown in Table 3, Table 4 for SD400 and SD600 wheels, respectively.

By changing the grinding angle on two of the facets you end up with a much more acute point. Start making the Shear Spear the same as the regular pyramid point tool. When you start grinding, grind only one bevel at 45°, as in Figure 4, and keep going until the bevel extends about two thirds of the tool diameter.
