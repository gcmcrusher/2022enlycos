## mineral processing metallurgy Britannica
mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy. The primary operations are comminution and concentration, but there are other important operations

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.150.2mm.

First, wood (typically hardwood) was burned to ashes. The wood ashes were collected into a pot with water, and then leached to produce lye. At this point, the lye solution was a basic phase of potash and could be used to manufacture products such as soap. The lye solution could also be processed further using heat (either boiling or baking) to
