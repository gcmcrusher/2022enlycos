Attrition scrubbers are also called attrition cells, which are generally used before or after sand screws in sand washing plant to scrub the surfaces of particulates, break down impurities, and remove it from competent aggregate material to reduce the product turbidity. We design singl and multiple cell attrition scrubber units for different scrubbing requirements of mineral materials.

## Attrition characteristics of iron ore by an air jet in gassolid 
The effects of superficial gas velocity (U g = 1.25–3.00 m/s) and distributor hole size (8.0–12.4 mm) on the attrition rate of iron ore in a gassolid fluidized bed with 0.076 m ID × 3.7 m height with or without solid circulation have been determined. The particle density and the Sauter mean diameter of fresh iron ore were 3705 kg/m 3 and 357 μm, respectively.

## SciELO Brasil Influence of attrition variables on iron ore 
Attrition is present in the flowcharts of the beneficiation process of phosphate and industrial sand (silica sand). Research has been undertaken for its application to produce preconcentrates of zircon and iron ore. However, there is still little knowledge of the influence of the attrition variables on the beneficiation process of iron ore.

Iron ore is a central mineral used in the steel industry. Despite its widespread use, testing is often done to create a valuable endproduct that meets industry standards. Items such as attrition, crush strength, compression, and bulk density are also measured through various stages of testing to, again, create the anticipated endproduct.
