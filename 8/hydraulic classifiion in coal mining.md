hydraulic mining, use of a powerful jet of water to dislodge minerals present in unconsolidated material, including mine tailings, placer deposits, alluvium, laterites (soil rich in iron oxides), and saprolites (soil rich in clay). It has also been applied to consolidated materials from sandstones through coal to hard rock. Hydraulic mining encompasses hydraulicking, sluicing, and educing.

In all but a very few cases, stimulation by hydraulic fracturing is required for adequate production rates. The application of fracturing to improve degasification of coal beds prior to mining began in 1974, but in recent years its application has expanded such that many completions are independent of any expected future mining operations.
