Large receiving opening per dollar of investment. Shape of receiving opening favourable for blocky feed. This, plus point 1, give the jaw a definite advantage over the gyratory, except in the very large sizes, for handling rock of massive formation. The jaw crusher is more easily adjusted, to compensate for wear of liners.
