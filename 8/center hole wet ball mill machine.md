## Milling Machine Terminology Sherline Products
The milling machine is the workhorse of the machine shop. In essence, a vertical mill is like a drill press except it is fitted with sturdy bearings capable of handling side as well as end loads. Normally up to 85% of machining jobs will require a mill rather than a lathe. Unlike a lathe that spins the material, a mill holds the material firmly

They are commonly used for wet milling in pharmaceutical processing the hole size depends on the moisture and density of the wet mass. By conditioning the wet material it improves the drying efficiency and reduces the production of fines. Due to the high open area they allow for processing of wet material without any screen blinding.

A rule of thumb for diameters larger than 25 mm: milling is costefficient up to a series of approx. 500 holes. When a range of hole sizes are to be machined. Limited tool magazine space to store many drill sizes. Production of blind holes, when a flat bottom is required. Nonrigid, thin walled components.

For an extremely basic answer, an end mill is rotated in the spindle of a milling machine and moved against a piece of material (metal or otherwise) and the rotating 'blades' on the edge of the tool will slice away material to produce the desired form or shape. Originally an end mill was used to remove material using only the cutting flutes
