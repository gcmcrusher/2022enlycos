Ball Mill Explained saVRee. For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 3045%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.
