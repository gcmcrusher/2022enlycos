## Mill tolerance and Piping Stress Analysis PED – Piping Stress 
Someone wrote around " According to my understanding, Mill Tolerance is the tolerance for variation in the thickness of pipe from nominal pipe thickness which is 12.5% according to B31.3 ". This is not correct. EN 13480, ASME B31.1 and B31.3 often address to pipe tolerance, but they normally don't define its value.
