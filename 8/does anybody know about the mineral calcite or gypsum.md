Calcite will not have any noticeable salty taste but halite will. However this diagnostic test is ill advised and usually frowned upon, as many minerals are not only soluble, but also toxic to humans, eg heavy metal minerals. It can also damage a nice specimen.

Calcite is a rockforming mineral with a chemical formula of CaCO3. It is widespread and found throughout the world in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Some geologists consider it to be a "ubiquitous mineral" – one that is found everywhere. Calcite is classed as a carbonate and has a vitreous or glassy luster.

Calcite also forms flat, rhomboid "poker chip" crystals, but dolomite does not. Calcite responds vigorously to acid, while dolomite responds less vigorously. Calcite is 3 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, but dolomite is only Mohs 44.5. One other difference you may see is the smoothness of the crystal faces on your specimen.

As a consequence, gypsum typically occurs as layers associated with limestone, dolostone, shale, and rock salt.

Selenite can look similar to calcite, but the main identifier is that selenite is very soft. Gypsum is a 2 and calcite is a 3. It's only a difference of 1 on the Mohs scale, but it's a huge difference because a fingernail has a hardness of 2.5. You can scratch selenite with your fingernail but not calcite.
