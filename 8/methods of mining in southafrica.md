In 2018 the mining sector contributed R351 billion to the South African gross domestic product (GDP) A total of 456,438 people were employed in the mining sector in 2018. Each person employed in the mining sector has up to nine indirect dependants. The mining sector has, for many years, attracted valuable foreign direct investment to South Africa.

The first diamonds were uncovered at the site of the Big Hole in 1871. Until the mine's closure in 1914, up to 50,000 miners excavated the deepest hole ever dug by hand, extending 215 metres underground. While the mine would yield 2,720kg of diamonds and help establish the De Beers mining company, which remains a major industry player to this

The Impala platinum mine is located in the North West province of South Africa, approximately 25km northwest of Rustenburg and 140km west of Pretoria. The project is a 10shaft mining complex covering a total area of approximately 250km 2 . The Impala platinum mine exploits the Merensky and UG2 Reefs of the Bushveld Igneous Complex.

In 1975, South Africa was responsible for producing 40% of the gold ever mined. By 2010, however, China affirmed its status as the world's largest gold producer with production of 324 tonnes of gold, followed by Australia (222.8 tonnes), and South Africa with 219.8 tonnes. Today, South Africa produces only 4.2% of the world's gold.

There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and insitu mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels, beach sands, or other environments.

The mining value chain is the historic bedrock of South Africa's economy. It directly contributes more than 300 billion rand to GDP, directly employs more than 450,000 people, and is the economic anchor of many communities around the country. Unfortunately, much of the news about South African mining in recent years has been negative.

The South African mining industry has consistently increased the size of its workforce, from 406,994 in 2001 to 453,543 in 2018. This has led to a parallel increase in the tax paid by mining companies to the national government, from $1.21bn in 2010 to $1.56bn in 2018, according to the country's Minerals Council.

Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining – Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface.

The relative depth of the deposit and economic value of the mineral play a key role in determining which method of mining to be used. An underground mine could be as shallow as 300 meters or as deep as 3 kilometers. For example, earth's deepest underground mine, Mponeng Gold Mine, located in South Africa, has an operating depth beyond 3.1 km.
