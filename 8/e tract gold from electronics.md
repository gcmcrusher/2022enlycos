## How to Extract Gold From Scrap Electronics And Jewelry
Gold is a precious, conductive, and pliable metal that retains a stable value better than many commodities. Its chemical properties make it useful for the manufacture of computers parts, electronics, jewelry and dental work. Some people find it profitable to attempt to extract the gold from these scraps, then refine and sell it.

The global gold supply recycled from electronics reached above $7 billion in 2018. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that only 1520 percent of WEEE is recycled; the rest goes straight into landfills and incinerators. What's more, the lure of the urban mine has driven growth in the unregulated recovery of metals from WEEE.
