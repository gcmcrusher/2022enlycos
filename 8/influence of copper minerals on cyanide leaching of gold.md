## A Review of the Cyanidation Treatment of CopperGold Ores and  MDPI
The production of copper concentrates from coppergold sulfide minerals by froth flotation generally results in tailings with copper, silver, and gold values. The cyanidation of copper flotation tailings containing sulfides for gold recovery is an example of the formation of cyanide complexes with copper and silver during the leaching process

3. Factor Affecting Gold Leaching: Cyanide Agent Dosage. Gold is a kind of inactive metal, which can cause complexation reaction with cyanogen (CN) under the action of oxygen in the cyanide leaching process, and then results in Au (CN) 2. Therefore, cyanide agent dosage is one of the key factors determining the gold dissolution.

CuSO4 2 NaCN = Cu (CN)2 Na2SO4. Cupric cyanide, when precipitated thus, is greenish yellow in color. On standing for a short time, or on heating, the precipitate changes to white flocculent cuprous cyanide. This is due to the decomposition of the unstable cupric cyanide into cuprous cyanide and cyanogen: 2 Cu (CN)2 = 2 CuCN (CN)2.
