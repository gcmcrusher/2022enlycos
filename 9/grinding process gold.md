The gold dissolution rate is dependent on the concentration of NaCN and the alkalinity of the solution, the optimum pH being 10.3. For efficient leaching, the gold should occur as free, finesize, clean particles in an ore that contains no "cyanicides" or impurities that might destroy cyanide or otherwise inhibit the dissolution reaction.
