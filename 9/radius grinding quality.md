## What is edge rounding with radius 2? QFin
Lian explains what this entails and why it is sometimes necessary. "A radius is a straight line running from the centre of a circle to the edge, half a diameter. When you round off sheet metal parts, you create an edge with a certain radius. Radius 2, also known as R2 or R=2, means a radius of 2 mm.".

## What is Radius grinder? Professional industrial design services, High 
A radius grinder (or radius tool grinder) is a special grinder used for grinding the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it may be used for other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary.

When selecting the cutter size for the final corner, if possible, you should always use an endmill with a smaller diameter than the equivalent corner radius of your feature. For example: if you have a pocket with .063 radius corners, DO NOT use a 1/8 end mill (this creates a .0625 radius). You need to select a smaller endmill such as a 3/32

## Edge rounding machine for safety and surface treatments
Advantages of mechanical edge rounding. It saves time, labour and costs compared to manual edge rounding. The metal part gets a uniform edge round that makes it suitable for coating, welding or other surface treatments. The machinery can achieve a radius of up to 2 mm. The processed sheet metal components are of high, consistent quality.

The edge rounding of metal sheet components with a radius of 2 mm (R=2, R2) or a radius larger than 2 mm (R=2, R2) is necessary at times. For example, when components require a powder coating. With a too low radius, you do not have an optimal coating of the edges. This is because the powder coating tends to withdraw itself from the edges
