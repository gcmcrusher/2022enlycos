Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and wastewater treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

In contrast, flotation was repressed in the rsmA background, but restored in the strain carrying pJRrsmA.

Increase uptime and ease the maintenance burden. Separating minerals in a froth flotation cell has a particularly corrosive effect on a slowly rotating rake and its components. Mixtures of slurry, surfactant, water, air and froth can quickly lead to failed seals and bearings. Which, of course, means costly unplanned downtime and lost productivity.
