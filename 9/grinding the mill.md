Batch grinding was like opencircuit grinding when the amounts of media, ore, and water in the mill were the same. The types of grind, capacities, efficiencies, and powers were the same. Rods did more grinding than an equal volume of balls, but more power was required. Rods of extremely small diameter gave more selective grinding than large balls.
