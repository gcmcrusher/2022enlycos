How Cone Crushers Work. Feed from a feed hopper is fed into a large opening at the top of the cone crusher. Feed then falls due to gravity and is crushed between the mantle and concaves; crushing takes place in the crushing chamber. As the feed moves towards the drive end of the cone crusher, its size decreases (due to the crushing action), and
