Sand particles derived from sandstone are deliv ered to the crusher hopper as rocks and boulders . Unlike mine crushing where the purpose is to reduce the size of the rocks to go into mills, the goal in frac sand operations is to liberate sand particles from the rocks while minimizing internal stress fractures in the sand particles.
