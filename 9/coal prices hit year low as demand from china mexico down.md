## Coal power's sharp rebound is taking it to a new record in 2021  IEA
In 2021, prices were lifted further by demand outstripping supply in China – the global coal price setter – as well as by supply disruptions and higher natural gas prices globally. Coal prices reached alltime highs in early October 2021, with imported thermal coal in Europe, for example, hitting USD 298 per tonne.

## Executive summary – Coal 2021 – Analysis IEA
With electricity demand outpacing lowcarbon supply, and with steeply rising natural gas prices, global coal power generation is on course to increase by 9% in 2021 to 10 350 terawatthours (TWh) – a new alltime high. However, coal's share of the global power mix in 2021 is expected to be 36% – 5 percentage points below its 2007 peak.
