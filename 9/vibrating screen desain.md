As the name implies, vibrating screen design is based on the principle of transferring vibrations to a screening surface in order to separate and classify different particles by size. Regardless of the machine's design, the principle remains the same: vibrations break down the surface tension between particles, in turn forcing them to

## Industrial Vibrating Screens Advantages & Its Uses
Vibrating screen design is entirely based upon the principle of transferring vibrations to a screening surface for the separation. The main component of screen is built by a vibrant chassis which assists several surfaces or elements of screening. This being said, the screen distinguishes foreign particles based on their size, shape and density.
