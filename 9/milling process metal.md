The metal fabrication method called machining refers to the process of shaping metal by removing the unwanted material from it. This process can be performed in a variety of ways. There are many different machining processes, including drilling, turning, and milling. Drilling uses a rotary cutting tool, the drill bit, to cut a hole in the material.

Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed, the overall removal is quite brisk.
