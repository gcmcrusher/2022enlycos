The risk of magnesium toxicity is increased in renal impairment and failure because of reduced ability to remove excess magnesium. In mild renal impairment, fractional excretion of magnesium increases to compensate for loss of glomerular filtration, but this becomes inadequate by the time creatinine clearance is under 30 mL/min.
