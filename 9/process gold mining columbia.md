## The impact of artisanal gold mining, ore processing and mineralization 
Colombia has a long and rich history of gold mining, dating back to the preColonial era (Brooks et al., 2016).Gold mining is an important economic driver in the impoverished rural regions in Colombia, with around 300,000 miners working in the artisanal and smallscale gold mining (ASGM) sector on a mainly subsistence basis, producing an estimated 54 metric tonnes (Mt) of gold annually (Cordy

## Gold Refining Step by Step Process: A Useful Discussion
Gold refining is a group of processes to pull out and set the precious metal apart from recycled elements (such as electronics and jewelry), mined materials, etc. The two most popular refining techniques to extract pure gold include the Wohlwill process and the Miller process.. Whereas the Miller process produces around 99.5% of pure gold, the Wohlwill process has managed to enhance the purity

This is a list of mining areas in Colombia. The mineral industry of Colombia is large and diverse; the country occupies the first place in mining areas per surface area in the world. In preColumbian times, mining of gold, silver, copper, emeralds, salt, coal and other minerals was already widespread. Precious metals as gold, and silver, platinum, nickel and coltan are located in different

In 2017, Colombia recorded one million acres of forest loss due to gold mining, which was 46% higher than in 2016 (DuPée 2018). Gold mining also yields mercury emissions, which are released when the gold ore is processed. Many smallscale operations use mercury to process gold because it is more cost effective.
