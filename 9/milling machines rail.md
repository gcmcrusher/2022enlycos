## Rail milling solutions to improve costs and performance
The rotational grinder on the machine finishes the rail to a surface roughness of 5 to 10 Microns, leaving a perfect running surface. All dust and debris from the milling of metal chips are removed from the track following treatment, and as rail milling is a cold process, no damage is caused to the metallurgy of the rail.

The milling work is being done in a onepass operation. "TTC requires an average metal removal of 0.8mm of metal per pass at the top of rail, allowing about 450m of finished track per hour with the SF02WFS hirail milling machine," Stock said. The cutting head can accommodate both the 100 or 115pound rail sections found in the TTC subways.

Railways, trams, metros, and all railways are subject to a permanent wear process. In order to increase driving safety and at the same time extend the rail life and reduce lifecycle costs, rails must be maintained regularly. In order to minimise operational disruptions that occur during this process, LINSINGER has developed special rail milling machines .

## What's the milling train and how will it help us save £3.5bn?
The rail milling train renews track by grinding away the damaged top layer of steel on the rail. It has wheels with hundreds of cutting tips, which spin to shave off small pieces of rail. Doing this slowly means the train consistently shaves off all the defects as it passes. We estimate this machine, which we started using in June 2018

Milling machines can remove 1.5 to 3 mm from the rail head and up to 5 mm from the gage corner, on the inside of a rail, in a single pass. The milling depth depends on the number and diameter of the cutting heads which move in a single pass over the rail at between 0.5 and 1.5 mph.

I have milled "R.R.rail" many times to make paralells for 40' castings on a very large large planer mill. It will mill like any hot rolled steel, being that is just what it is. If it is used rail it may be somewhat work hardened from wheel burnishing. But this is not a problem. It wont be that hard, just a little compressed.

How the MultiContour High Rail Gantry Milling Machine Gets It Done. Control. By eliminating the crossrail support columns found in other vertical bridge mills in favor of a fixed rail design, high rail gantries have less weight — and thus force and momentum — to compensate for as they operate, which means finer control.

Rail milling has a number of advantages over conventional rail maintenance technologies. Due to the variable low to high onepass metal removal capability – as little as 0.1mm (0.004in); as high as 10mm (0.4in) dependent on machine size – rail damage can be completely removed, and the profile can be fully restored.
