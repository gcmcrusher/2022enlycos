4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or openpit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions. Small, lowcapacity mines have rapidly disappeared.
