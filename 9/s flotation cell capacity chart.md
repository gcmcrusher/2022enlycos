no flotation can occur. Contact between particles and bubbles can be accomplished in a flotation cell such as the one shown schematically in Figure 5. Figure 5: Simplified schematic of a conventional flotation cell. The rotor draws slurry through the stator and expels it to the sides, creating a suction that draws air down the shaft of the stator.
