## Raw Mill Feeding Cement Plant Optimization
Hoppers for limestone/ clay/ iron ore serve the purpose of providing a buffer storage for mill feed and a convenient arrangement for feeding to weigh feeders for proportioning purpose. Hoppers used to be designed to hold the requirements of one shift. However, with raw mill capacities reaching 250700 tph it is no longer practical to do so.

If the hopper feeder conveyor moves material at 1,000 tph at a belt speed of 100 fpm it will move material at 2,000 tph at a belt speed of 200 fpm. That is because the handling rate is linearly proportional to the belt speed.
