## Definition of flotation cell Mindat
Definition of flotation cell. Appliance in which froth flotation of ores is performed. It has provision for receiving conditioned pulp, aerating this pulp and for separate discharge of the resulting mineralized froth and impoverished tailings. Types of cell include (1) agitation (impeller, and splashing, now obsolete); (2) pneumatic (in which

Flotation cell technology became the economic salvation of mining in Montana and the West in the late 1920's. It allowed the mining of lowgrade ore bodies after the richer deposits were exhausted. During the Great Depression, some mines remained solvent while others were operated at a subsistence level or went bellyup.

The quiet zone cell, the invention of J.M. McClave, Abasand's consulting engineer, is sufficiently novel to warrant a preliminary description. It consists of an inclined trough or shell containing a spiral ribbon, the trough or shell being so deep at the feed end that the ribbon conveyor is submerged beneath a considerable depth of water.
