After the milling process the nanoparticles were collected using a magnetic field. The structure, morphology and composition of the powders were obtained using highresolution electron microscopy. HREM images confirmed the nanoparticles' presence

## Synthesis of TiN/Si3N4 composite powders by mechanically activated 
TiN/Si3N4 composite powders were obtained by a process that combines the mechanical activation of titanium and silicon powders at room temperature through highenergy milling with an isothermal annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere to complete the synthetic reaction. Mechanical activation has allowed us to complete the synthesis at 1350 °C only. The β–Si3N4 content in the final powder tends

## Synthesis of a cubic Ti(BCN) advanced ceramic by a solidgas 
Abstract In this work, a titanium boron carbonitride advanced ceramic was successfully synthesised by a solidgas mechanochemical reaction in a planetary ball mill from a mixture of elemental Ti, B, and C under nitrogen atmosphere. This material, with a general formula of Ti(BCN), exhibits a facecentred cubic structure (NaCl type) that is analogous to Ti(CN). This phase was gradually formed

## Mechanisms of SelfSustained Reaction in Mechanically Induced 
We report the results from the investigation of the mechanisms of selfsustained reaction in mechanically induced TiN/B nanocomposites. The exothermic displacement reaction, 3B TiN → BN TiB2, with an adiabatic reaction temperature of 1905 K, was initiated through two different means: localized thermal heating and mechanical stimulation by highenergy ball milling. Comprehensive studies
