The main component I needed was a dividing head. I recently acquired one, so I was ready to embark on the adventure of gear cutting! The first thing I had to do was cut a gear blank. This particular gear is an 80 tooth gear with a diametrical pitch of 12. The gear blank needs to be (n2)/dp, or 82/12″, or 6.833 inches in my case.

Step 9: Rack and Pinion. The rack and pinion converts the rotational motion of a gear (the pinion) to the linear motion of a rack. The pinion is just like any other spur gear, and it meshes with the rack, which is a rail with teeth. The rack slides continuously as the gear rotates.

This is an example of making a spur gear. It is done step by step. The gear to be made has 35 teeth. The size of the teeth is 1 MOD. For a 1 mod gear the pitch circle diameter, pcd is the number of teeth in mm. The outside diameter, od is: OD = pcd mod  2. = 37mm. for this example the gear is made of steel 1/4 inch thick.
