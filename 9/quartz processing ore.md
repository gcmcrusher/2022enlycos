It is true that once you get to processing large enough amounts of ore you are likely to need environmental permits, etc., depending on the location you are working in. Most prospectors will choose to stay small, but even on a small scale, you can be processing goldquartz ores recovering some very good gold and getting into real hard rock mining.

3. Goldbearing quartz vein ore containing a small amount of sulfide. This ore is most common in goldbearing quartz veins ore and generally contains 1% to 5% of metal sulfides. According to the state of gold production, it can be divided into two types: one is associated with sulphide ore, another is associated with gangue minerals such as quartz.

Quartz reef mining is a type of gold mining in "reefs" (veins) of quartz. Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the earth's crust, and most quartz veins do not carry gold, but those that have gold are avidly hunted by prospectors. All the ore was hoisted to the surface for processing. Water had to be removed by pumping. Big hoisting
