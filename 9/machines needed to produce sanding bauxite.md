## Bauxite Ore Pixelmon Generations Wiki
Bauxite Ore. Bauxite is a new ore introduced in Pixelmon. Its main usage is the manufacturing of several Pixelmon machines. Bauxite can be found within stone at height levels between 30 and 60, in veins of up to eight blocks. It is also a drop from certain wild Pokémon. Bauxite ore requires at least an iron pickaxe to break.
