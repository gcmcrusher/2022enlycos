In 1948, an industrial breakthrough of highspeed stirred ball mills occurred with the introduction of DuPont's "sand mill," which used milling media in the range 0.42–0.84 mm. It was efficiently used in the paint and lacquer industry as a pigment grinder. At present, grinding beads and balls have replaced sand.
