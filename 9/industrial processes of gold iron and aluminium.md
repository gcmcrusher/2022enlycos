Approximately threequarters of the iron ore used by domestic integrated steel mills to make iron and steel originated in the United States in 1998. Brazil, Canada, and Venezuela accou nted for more than 90% of iron ore imports, which average about 15 million metric tons per year. Domestic consumption of iron ore was about 78 Mt in 1998.

## Top 10 Uses of Aluminium in the Industry Today Matmatch
Using aluminium components in place of steel can have advantages: aluminium is easier to form and improves efficiency. While railways were once made mainly from iron, many elements of modern trains are made from aluminium. In fact, aluminium's strengthtoweight ratio is one of the main factors that makes train speeds of over 350 km/h possible.
