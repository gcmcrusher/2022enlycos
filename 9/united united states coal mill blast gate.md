## How steelmaking may go carbonfree—by dropping its addiction to coal
Coal's grip on the global electricity sector is loosening as more utilities and companies invest in renewable energy. But one major coal consumer—the steel industry—is finding it harder to kick its habit. Steel companies make nearly 2 billion tons of highstrength material every year for bridges, buildings, railways, and roads.

Since 1985, the price of thermal coal at the mine gate has decreased from CDN $26.50 ($35.38 constant 1992$) to CDN $19.16 ($16.88 constant 1992$). The development of coalfired electricity generating facilities, particularly in the United States may increase the demand for thermal coal and thus moderate prices over the longer term.
