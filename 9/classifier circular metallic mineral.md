## USGS Circular 1289 USGS Mineral Resources Program Supporting 
The need for information on metallic mineral resources helped lead to the creation of the USGS in 1879. In response to the need to assess large areas of Federal lands in the 20th century, Program scientists developed, tested, and refined tools to support managers making landuse decisions on Federal lands.

Jadeite. Jadeite (a pyroxene) and nephrite (a member of the amphibole mineral group) are the only two minerals that can legally be called "jade" in commerce. Both of these minerals are used to produce cabochons, beads, bangles, small sculptures, and a wide variety of utility items.Jadeite is the most important gemstone in China, where it has been held in highest esteem for thousands of years.

Nonmetallic mineral reserves include stone and clay quarries, sand pits, chemical and fertiliser mineral resources, salt deposits, quartz deposits, gypsum, natural gemstones, asphalt and bitumen, peat, and other nonmetallic minerals besides coal and oil. Metallic minerals are those that include one or more metals, as the name implies.

Fibrous. Fibrous is a habit name used when minerals occur in very fine fiberlike crystals. They are often so fine that they look like fine hair. The habit also includes aggregates made up of a large number of parallel or radial fibers. Mineral examples: actinolite, chrysotile, serpentine, and tremolite.

## mineral Classification of minerals Britannica
Classification of minerals. Since the middle of the 19th century, minerals have been classified on the basis of their chemical composition.Under this scheme, they are divided into classes according to their dominant anion or anionic group (e.g., halides, oxides, and sulfides).Several reasons justify use of this criterion as the distinguishing factor at the highest level of mineral classification.

Hydroxides are compounds of metallic elements with water or the hydroxyl anion (OH). Examples of hydroxides are manganite (MnO (OH)), goethite (FeO (OH)), and gibbsite (Al (OH)3; one of the main components of bauxite). Minerals of the hydroxide class are typically softer than oxides and are of low to medium density.
