Coal seam gas production. There has been very strong growth in the Australian CSG sector. Production in 1995 was zero and this had only increased to some 20 petajoules (PJ) by 2003. Note: A petajoule (PJ) is a unit of energy and is equivalent to 10 15 joules. A megajoule (MJ) is equivalent to 10 6 joules.

Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coalfired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into highpressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

Coal is Australia's largest commodity export, earning over $40 billion in 2008. Australia is also the world's largest exporter of coal, exporting over 250 million tonnes in 2008. The black coal industry employs over 30,000 Australians directly and a further 100,000 indirectly. It provides 57 per cent of our electricity generation.

A good example of this is the emissions benefit of using liquid natural gas (LNG) as a fuel source. While the process of liquefying gas is emissions intensive, LNG when used as a substitute for coalfired electricity, results in a net reduction in emissions. The environmental benefits of natural gas will be further explored later in this chapter.
