The Limestone Mine is a mining location which lies on Silvarea west of the temple Paterdomus and northeast of Varrock.It is located near the start location for the Rag and Bone Man I quest.Players can mine limestone from the rocks found here, which can be used for Construction.. This area rarely sees people mining here, for limestone can be obtained from the Grand Exchange at a reasonable price.
