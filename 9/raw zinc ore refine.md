## zinc processing Ores Britannica
Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world, although more than 40 percent of the world's output originates in North America and Australia. The common zinccontaining minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS), a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S], and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or smithsonite (ZnCO3). The geology of zinc

Zinc and lead are closely bonded with each other and coexists in raw ore. For example, galena (PbS) and sphalerite (ZnS) are detected as associated minerals in natural mines. Most of zinc metal production are from zinc sulfide ore, which mainly exists in the form of sphalerite, maramatite and wurtzite.

Zinc Manufacturing. In the most common hydrometallurgical process for zinc manufacturing, the ore is leached with sulfuric acid to extract the lead/zinc. These processes can operate at atmospheric pressure or as pressure leach circuits. Lead/zinc is recovered from solution by electrowinning, a process similar to electrolytic refining.

Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless specific

The extracted impure metal is called crude metal. Refining of metals is the final process. After the extraction process the metal is free from impurities. The refining method to be chosen will depend on the physical and chemical properties of a particular metal. There are different methods of making a metal pure : Distillation. Liquation. Poling.

In metallurgy, refining consists of purifying an impure metal. It is to be distinguished from other processes such as smelting and calcining in that those two involve a chemical change to the raw material, whereas in refining, the final material is usually identical chemically to the original one, only it is purer.
