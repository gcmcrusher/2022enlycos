A Chinese subbituminous Shenfu (SF) coal was steam treated under atmospheric pressure and the caking and coking properties of the treated coals were evaluated by caking indexes (G RI) and crucible coking characterizations.The results show that steam treatment can obviously increase the G RI of SF coal. When the steam treated coals were used in the coal blends instead of SF raw coal, the micro

Definition of caking coal. Coal that softens and agglomerates on heating and after volatile matter has been driven off at high temperatures; produces a hard gray cellular mass of coke. All caking coals are not good coking coals. Click here to see list of references, authorities, sources and geographical terms as used in this glossary.

In coal utilization: Thermoplastic properties. .exhibit such behaviour are called caking coals. Strongly caking coals, which yield a solid product (coke) with properties suitable for use in a blast furnace, are called coking coals. All coking coals are caking, but not all caking coals are suitable for coke making.

## Coking quality and caking properties of western Canadian coals
Abstract. Methods exist for predicting coke strength from the caking (thermal rheological) or petrographic properties of a metallurgical coal. These methods, which were derived for Carboniferous coals, frequently indicate that western Canadian Cretaceous coals would not make high quality coke yet both types of coals can produce excellent coke suitable for iron blast furnaces.

Caking Properties of Coals. This is a unique property of coals in the bituminous group of coals and is an essential property for coals which are required for coking. As a caking coal is heated it passes through a region where it becomes very plastic, softens, swells and then re solidifies. The residue is a cellular coke mass.
