Grinding mills are classified by the media used for grinding. The more common types of mills are: Ball mills These mills use forged steel balls up to 5 inches (127 mm) in diameter to crush and grind the material. Mill length is two or more times its diameter. Rod mills Steel rods up to 4.5 inches (114 mm) in diameter and slightly shorter
