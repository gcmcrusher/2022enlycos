## Pressure Filters Water Treatment Solutions
In water treatment, it is often required to remove small particulate matter from the raw water. One of the most costeffective ways to accomplish this is with a pressure filter. Sometimes referred to as "sand filters," a pressure filter consists of a rigid filter vessel capable of withstanding internal pressure, combined with pipework to distribute and collect water and one or multiple

## Filtration MRWA
Filter Sand . The filter sand used in rapid sand filters is manufactured specifically for the purpose of water filtration. Most rapid sand filters contain 2430 inches of sand, but some newer filters are deeper. The sand used is generally 0.4 to 0.6 mm in diameter. This is larger than the sand used in slow rate filtration.
