Cold rolling plays a crucial role in flat steel production. In recent years, it has become extremely difficult to ignore the existence of chatter, also called "ghost vibration" by operators who work in milling plants [], which restricts the quality and efficiency of strip production.Fig. 1 shows the layout of a tandem cold rolling process. Mill vibration often occurs in stand 4 and 5

A Bridgeport mill is a standard manual kneetype vertical milling machine. The reason that many people refer to a manual mill simply as a "Bridgeport" is because it's one of the most famous brand names that's found in most machine shops.

This vibration is usually, but not necessarily, in a vertical plane. Vibration mills are similar to ball mills in that particles of the materials are crushed between porcelain or metal balls and the mill body. Drugs and excipients are readily ground to less than 5 mm, the grinding time being considerably less than is required in normal ball
