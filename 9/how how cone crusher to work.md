## How Do Cone Crushers Work? – SJCSKS
A cone crusher is a crushing device wherein the mantle rotates eccentrically. This eccentric motion causes the gap between the mantle and concave to move from the narrow setting to the widest setting. This movement increases the crushing force. The mantle is a fixed ring inside the upper casing of the crusher.

## How to Choose the Lubricating Oil of Hydraulic Cone Crusher?
For the components of the cone crusher, parts that work under heavy loads require a more viscous lubricant. For example, when the bearing pressure is large, the oil is pressed out from the bearing and then operated in a dry state, which tends to generate a high working temperature, so a more viscous lubricating oil is used.
