In the modern industry, vibratory bowl feeders VBF have been widely used to feed small and light parts such as USB caps. In this method, the bowl's vibration, which caused by forced vibration and the friction between parts and track, helps convey the parts out of the feeder along the track. However, ensuring that the directional requirements before going out works correctly depends entirely
