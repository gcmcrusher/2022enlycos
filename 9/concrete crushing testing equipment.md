## What equipment is used to determine the crushing strength of concrete 
Crushing strength tests determine the maximum load that concrete can bear before it begins to fracture. In some cases, a test piece of concrete in the form of a cylinder or prism is placed in a concrete compression machine or a similar testing apparatus. Once you've secured the concrete in the machine, you gradually increase the load, test
