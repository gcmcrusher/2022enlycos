Working Principle of Crushers. On left is a showing of the "standard gyratory with straight concaves" is a section through any vertical, radial plane in the crushing chamber of one of the intermediate sizes of the crusher. In order to understand the crushing action in such a chamber it is helpful to consider the process as though each step took place in an orderly, and "ideal" fashion.

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a Vbelt or direct drive.
