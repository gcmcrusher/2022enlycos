## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wearresistant plate

zQuartz is the most common mineral next to feldspar in the earth's crest. It is the crystalline form of silicon dioxide, SiO2, also named silica. The total silica content of a rock issilica. The total silica content of a rock is decisive for its abrasive properties: The higher the silica content, the higher the wear on the crusher liners.

Mineral chips are usually tumbled to slightly tumbled pieces that can range in size and shape. Most shops buy mineral chips from a wholesaler (usually China) and then resell them on ETSY or elsewhere. They are rarely curated or tumbled by the actual seller. Crushed minerals are very different! They are not mass produced or offered at wholesale.

Silica sand mining process. The whole silica sand mining process generally includes the following steps: crushing, grinding and separation. In the crushing process, the raw materials firstly sent into the jaw crusher for the primary crushing, if necessary, the crushed materials will enter in the impact crusher or cone crusher for further crushing.

Silica is the common name for silicon dioxide, a white or colorless compound found naturally in sand, granite and many other types of rock. Quartz is the most common form of silica and is the second most common mineral in the earth's surface. Since it is so abundant, quartz is present in nearly all mining operations.
