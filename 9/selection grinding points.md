The first thing to consider here is the material to be ground, for that will determine which abrasives you will want to use. The hardness and softness of the material can greatly affect the function of the grinding wheel, so proper matching is highly recommended. Grinding steels and alloys, for example, should require aluminum oxide abrasives.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? Norton Abrasives
A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond, which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.

Another factor that affects the choice of wheel bond is the wheel speed in operation. Usually vitrified wheels are used at speeds less than 6,500 surface feet per minute. At higher speeds, the vitrified bond may break. Organic bond wheels are generally the choice between 6,500 and 9,500 surface feet per minute.
