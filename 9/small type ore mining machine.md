Flotation is usually used by large scale miners but can also be applied in small scale operations. It is a process that works best for processing complex ore types, especially ores that are difficult to process using gravity methods. In flotation, a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and frothing agents are added into a flotation machine.
