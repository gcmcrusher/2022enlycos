Colonial. During the colonial period, the Republic of the Congo saw smallscale mechanized mining activities. During the 1960s French exploration companies identified vast evaporative zones containing sylvinite and carnallite mineralisation covering the Congo Basin.. In 1959 COMILOG commenced manganese extraction operations near the town of Moanda in Gabon, just across the Congolese border.
