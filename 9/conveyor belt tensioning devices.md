The role of the belt conveyor tensioning device is to ensure that the conveyor belt has a certain tension, so that the necessary friction between the conveyor belt and the roller is generated; to limit the sag of the conveyor belt between the supporting points, and to make the conveyor run normally. There are three types of tensioning device

In reality, undertensioning your belt cleaner, or having inconsistent maintenance processes, can be just as problematic for maintenance teams as overtensioning. Without enough tension on the belt cleaner blades, metal or polyurethane blades can bounce or chatter leading to shorter blade life, and an increase in carryback on the conveyor system.
