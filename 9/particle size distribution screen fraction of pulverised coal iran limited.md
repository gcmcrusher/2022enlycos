The particlesize distribution (PSD) of a powder, or granular material, or particles dispersed in fluid, is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount, typically by mass, of particles present according to size. Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil, etc. particles into the PSD that is then called a grain size distribution.

## CiteSeerX — Citation Query Introduction to particle technology
SAA process parameters studied were precipitator temperature, nozzle diameter, and drug concentration in the liquid solution. Their influence was evaluated on morphology and size of precipitated particles. Spherical particles with mean particle size ranging from 1 to 3 μm of the new antiasthma drug were produced by SAA.

## Improved Coal Fineness Improves Performance, Reduces Emissions
The absolute size constant "k" represents the most common particle size in the coal particle distribution. The value of "k" is the size at which the line crosses "R" equal to 36.79 (or

## Crusher Discharge T10 PSD Particle Size Distribution Crushing 
The T10 is useful as a single number which describes the Particle Size Distribution for the product from Crusher Discharge's operation relative to (size by size) feed size i.e. % passing 1/10th of parent size (s). Can T10, or a modified T10type number, be used to describe qualit

## Distribution Characteristics of Valuable Elements, Al, Li, and Ga, and 
The percentage of 5–40 mesh coal particles is the highest (reaches up to 67%), and the percentage of other particle sizes is less than 10%. Compared with the particle size of feed coal in a pulverized coal furnace, the size of feed coal in the CFB furnace is relatively bigger (0.4–3 mm).
