Application of the thioureaFe 3 leaching system resulted in recovery of 16.4 ± 1.56 mg/kg of gold from the finegrained PIR within 6 h of incubation. Due to high gold market prices, upscaling of the suggested technology can represent a suitable strategy for gold recovery from PIR and other MSWI residues.

One new study has taken alumina recovery research a step forward with some promising results; by combining a CaCl2 calcination step with H2SO4 leaching, researchers were able to obtain greater than a 95% recovery of alumina from the fly ash. In comparison, the study found direct acid leaching could only recover about 2 – 4.75% alumina.

Fly ash is a fine, powderlike material generated from coalburning power plants. And despite an increase toward more sustainable energy production, coalburning power plants are still prevalent, producing fly ash that could serve as a valuable commodity. Thus now is an important time as any to evaluate the way in which we look at this material, and consider it not a waste, but an opportunity
