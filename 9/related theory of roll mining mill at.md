A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

Hammermill Crushers are known to generate material finer than 3/16" (4mm), which in some applications may be undesirable. However, if there is a market for finer material, or if it is acceptable within the desired product size, Hammermills can achieve reduction ratios that may otherwise require multiple crushers.
