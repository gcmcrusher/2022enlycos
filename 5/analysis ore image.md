## Iron ore Fastmarkets
Iron ore is one of the most important steelmaking ingredients used by steelmakers across the globe. With the growing importance of green steel production driving the steel market to decarbonize, demand for lowcarbon steelmaking materials is evolving quickly to favor higher grades like the 65% iron ore. Our team of experts provides global and

You might have warm, cool, or neutral undertones in your skin, eyes, and hair. Your features may be very dark or they may be very light. And your overall appearance might be very muted, or it might be

## Image analysis for denoising fullfield frequencydomain fluorescence 
The polar plot projection, a rapid FLIM analysis method, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoising routine with exemplary data from both physical and complex biological samples. We also suggest broader impacts of the image analysis for other fluorescence microscopy techniques (e.g. superresolution imaging).
