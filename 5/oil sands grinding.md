Oil sands, tar sands, crude bitumen, or bituminous sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit.Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, soaked with bitumen, a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum.. Significant bitumen deposits are reported in Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela.

What are Oil Sands? Oil sands, also known as "tar sands," are sediments or sedimentary rocks composed of sand, clay minerals, water, and bitumen. The oil is in the form of bitumen, a very heavy liquid or sticky black solid with a low melting temperature. Bitumen typically makes up about 5 to 15% of the deposit.

## Calcined oil sands fine tailings as a supplementary cementing material 
2.1. Concrete mixes—materials and testing procedures. Three types of supplementary cementing pozzolans were used in this study: SF, MK, and calcined oil sands fine tailings (CFT). SF and MK were supplied from a local concrete producer, and CFT was produced by calcining the raw fine tailings at 700 °C with grinding in a local China factory.

First, producing oil from tar sands emits twotothree times the global warming pollution of conventional oil. But the process also diminishes one of the best carbonreduction tools on the planet: Canada's Boreal Forest.
