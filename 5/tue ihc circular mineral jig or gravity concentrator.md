An arrastra (or arastra) is a primitive mill for grinding and pulverizing (typically) gold or silver ore. Its simplest form is two or more flatbottomed drag stones placed in a circular pit paved with flat stones, and connected to a center post by a long arm. With a horse, mule or human providing power at the other end of the arm, the stones

Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al., 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al., 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 1 mm and −1 mm fractions.
