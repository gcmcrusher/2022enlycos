## Pulverizer Fire and Explosions
Pulverizer housing or burner lines are glowing red. Mill fires require immediate attention to prevent damage to the pulverizer and more damaging mill "puffs". Explosions in a pulverized coal system are normally called "puffs.". A mill puff is an explosion in the mill system caused by an explosive combination of coal, air and temperature.

## Pulverized coalfired boiler Wikipedia
A pulverized coalfired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.. The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.
