An alloy of gold and silver (which can occur naturally or be deliberately created) is called electrum and was sometimes regarded as more valuable than pure gold. Gold can also be alloyed with copper in various proportions to produce tumbaga, which was much used in ancient Peru. Since the color of tumbaga varied with the proportion of copper

Abstract. The technique of smelting mined gold ore concentrates reported by Diodorus Siculus as being used in Egypt in the Second Century B.C. has been simulated in the laboratory. A considerable degree of refining was found, comparable with that yielded by the medieval process of cementation with salt, and with a negligible loss of gold.
