8. Ensure operation within the cone crusher design limit. If the cone crusher operates beyond the upper limit of crushing force or exceeds the rated power, try to slightly increase the tight side discharge parameters and try to ensure "full cavity" operation, or reduce the feed rate slightly, but it may be difficult to ensure good grain size.

Usually, these crushers deliver a 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 reduction ratio. As you reduce the closed side setting to produce smaller material, you also reduce the capacity of the machine. Cone crushers are well adapted to handle many different types of material, but they're only able to accept material up to a certain size.

Gyradisk Cone Crusher. For finer size products (e.g., 6 mm), a special cone crusher known as the Gyradisc is commonly used. Operation is similar to the Standard Cone Head; however, breakage is mostly by attrition rather than impact. Reduction ratio is around 8:1. Feed size is limited to less than 50 mm with a nip angle between 25 ° and 30 °.

Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.
