biomass was prepared to approximately 1 to 6 mm by a disc refiner for ethanol production (US Patent 5 677 154, 1997). Such reduced particle sizes can be achieved by fine grinders (e.g. hammer mill, disc refiner, pin mill, chain mill). Long pieces of straw/stalk of biomass may not flow easily into grinders such as hammer and disc refiners.

If the biomass is quite large and dense (e.g., wood), the material is first run through a "chipper," and then run through a hammer mill or similar device to reduce the particles to the required size. Smaller and softer biomass (e.g., straw) can be fed directly into the hammer mill without first being chipped. Moisture Control

In this system, biomass is fed into a hammer mill and ground to pass through a quarterinch sieve. It is then blown into a holding tank called a surge bin. An auger at the bottom of the surge bin pulls ground material out of the bin where it drops into the pellet mill. Pellets come out of the machine and drop into the conveyor.
