## The Pumice Store: Lightweight Concrete Aggregate
Lightweight Pumice Aggregate for Craft Concrete applications. Lightweight Pumice Sand Plus. PUMICE CONCRETE is composed of Portland cement, pumice stones, pumice sand, pumice powder (pozzolan), and water. Compared to standard concrete, pumice concrete offers roughly a onethird reduction in weight and four times the rvalue.

Advantages of Lightweight Concrete (LWC) The important factor in design, particularly in the case of weak soil and tall structures is the dead weight of the structure. With the help of LWC, we can lower the dead weight/load. Usage of this LWC in floors and walls may further reduce the load on the foundation.
