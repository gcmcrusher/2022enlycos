## Environmental Performance & Leadership — Ash Grove
Ash Grove has one of the highest fuel substitution rates of any cement company in the world. Since 1987, Ash Grove has safely burned alternative fuels saving 3.5 million tons of coal. That's enough to fill more than 44,100 rail cars that would stretch endtoend from Kansas City, Missouri, to Denver, Colorado.
