## What is a Jaw Crusher? – MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws. Generally, this value is between 18 and 24 degrees in primary jaw crushers, and between 22 and 28 degrees in secondary
