Peter A. Claisse, in Civil Engineering Materials, 2016 17.9 Environmental impact. Cement production is one of the largest industries in the world. Annual world production in 2013 was approximately 4 GT (of which, about half was in China). It is produced in kilns at around 1400 o C (2500 o F), and approximately 750 kg (1650 lb) of CO 2 are released for each tonne (2205 lb.) that is made.

While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history (Malinowsky, 1991), the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century, first with shaft kilns, which were later

## History of cement Understanding Cement
A few years later, in 1845, Isaac Johnson made the first modern Portland Cement by firing a mixture of chalk and clay at much higher temperatures, similar to those used today. At these temperatures (1400C1500C), clinkering occurs and minerals form which are very reactive and more strongly cementitious.
