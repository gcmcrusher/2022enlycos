## Characteristics of leaching of heavy metals from lowsulfur coal gangue 
the hazards of coal gangue include the potential ecological and environmental impacts caused by harmful heavy metals (Dang et al. 1998). The stacking of coal gangue will cause the soil around the waste rock mountain to be polluted by the heavy metals in the coal gangue, and the main cause is the weathering of the coal gangue (Liu et al. 2003).

The acid method is a commonly used method because of its high efficiency and simple operation. Ren et al. prepared Al(OH) 3 from coal gangue by acid method, and the extraction rate of Al 2 O 3 in coal gangue reached 81.8% . Furthermore, the activation of coal gangue also contributes to the precipitation of useful elements.
