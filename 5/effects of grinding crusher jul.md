Grinding particle size. During the flotation process, the flotation effect of too coarse ore particles (greater than 0.1mm) and extremely fine ore particles (less than 0.006mm) is not good, and the recovery rate is low. 1. In the coarse flotation, due to the large weight, the shedding force of the ore particles increases.
