## Power rating of Resistors and Wattage Codrey Electronics
Units of Power rating. The power rating unit of a resistor is calculated in Watts. The electrical quantity watt is denoted by capital letter "W". Most resistors have power ratings in terms of watts. But sometimes we come across the power rating like mW, kW or MW. mW is an abbreviation of Milli Watt. 1mW = 1 / 1000 W.

## Resistors in Series and Parallel Boundless Physics  Course Hero
According to Ohm's law, the voltage drop, V, across a resistor when a current flows through it is calculated by using the equation V=IR, where I is current in amps (A) and R is the resistance in ohms (Ω). So the voltage drop across R 1 is V 1 =IR 1, across R 2 is V 2 =IR 2, and across R 3 is V 3 =IR 3. The sum of the voltages would equal: V=V

## 4 Ways to Calculate Series and Parallel Resistance wikiHow
The formula for calculating a total of n number of resistors wired in series is: R eq = R 1 R 2 . R n That is, all the series resistor values are simply added. For example, consider finding the equivalent resistance in the image below; In this example, R 1 = 100 Ω and R 2 = 300Ω are wired in series.
