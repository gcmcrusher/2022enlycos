## Optimizing Flotation Cells
Optimizing Flotation Cells. Flotation Cells (Froth Flotation) were developed to separate and recover high value Sulphide ores from low grade ore bodies. The ore is crushed and milled at the concentrator in a process known as comminution, where the mineral is in suspension in slurry. The particle size for mineral being recovered is generally

Controls directional flow of froth towards the launder. Improves froth properties and stability even in low grade/mass pull applications. Optimizes froth carry rate (FCR) and lip loading (LL) for each flotation duty by modifying the cell froth area and lip length. Minimizes transportation distance to prevent particle drop out from froth. Features.
