## Milling Machine SpindleDXMC
Milling Machine Spindle. Spindle is the most important part of milling machine, which is used to install the tool and drive the tool to rotate. Most of the milling machine equipment use multitooth cutting tools, so in the processing which will cause a sudden change in milling force, which is prone to vibration in the cutting, which requires the spindle part of a higher rigidity and vibration
