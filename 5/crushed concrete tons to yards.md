Step 4: Calculate The Tons In A Yard. The last step is to divide the density in lb/yard3 by the tons in US and metric or UK terms. If you want the US tons, you have to divide the density in lb/yard3 with 2000 and for the UK, divide it with 2200. US Ton In A Yard For Any Material = density in lb per yard3 /2000.

## How Many Yards In A Ton Of Gravel? Modern Design
To figure out how many yards are in a ton of gravel, you need to do some simple math. Gravel and crushed stone usually weighs around 2800 pounds per cubic yard. 1 ton of gravel weighs 2000 pounds. So to find out how many yards are in 1 ton of gravel, you divide 2000/ 2800 = 0.714 cubic yard. So, there are 0.714 cubic yards in a ton of gravel.
