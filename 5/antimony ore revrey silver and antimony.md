By the preliminary treatment the silver, and in part at least, the antimony and arsenic, are reduced to the metallic state, and are so found. The reduction is accomplished by the nascent hydrogen resulting from the action of caustic soda on the aluminium according to the following equation: (1) 2Al 2NaOH 2H2O = Na2Al2O4 6H.".

Antimony has become an increasingly critical element in recent years, due to a surge in industrial demand and the Chinese domination of primary production.

## Mineral Resource of the Month: Antimony EARTH Magazine
Antimony is the 63rdmost abundant element in Earth's crust. It is less abundant than tin, arsenic and the rare earths, but more so than bismuth, mercury and silver. Antimony tends to concentrate in sulfide ores along with copper, lead and silver. It occurs sparingly as a free element, but when it does it is usually in association with

## Antimony: will China continue to control supply?
Most people have never heard of antimony. It may have a lustrous silver colour that eyecatchingly sparkles and glistens, but it is, nevertheless, far from a headlinegrabbing commodity. ' Olimpiada mine in Russia, for example, which produces antimony as a byproduct, supplies around 20,000 tons of the ore to China, according to Backeberg

The Mineral antimony. Antimony is a native element that can occur in a natural state, but it is rarely pure. It almost always contains some arsenic, and may also contain traces of silver, iron, and sulfur. On a fresh or preserved surface, Antimony has a tinwhite color with a slight blue tinge. Otherwise, it is dark gray due to tarnish.

The amount of antimony in the crust of the Earth is between 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million (ppm). Although the compound is scarce, it is present in more than a hundred minerals. A pure sample of antimony can be extracted, but most of the time antimony is present in sulfide stibnite, which is the principal ore material.
