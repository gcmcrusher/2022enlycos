Hydration of cement results in gelforming around cement particles and growing into an interlocking matrix which coats soil particles. The effect of the use of cement in soil stabilization may be to lower the plasticity of the material and make it more moisture insensitive or to create an agglomerated structure of calcium silicate hydrates and calcium hydroxide which bound surrounding particles.
