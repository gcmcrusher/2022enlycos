## Manganese Deposit an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Despite the accumulation of a vast array of data on the geology of manganese deposits and particularly pertaining to the chemical composition of manganese rocks and ores, many questions of manganese oregenesis remain only partially answered. This is the case, first and foremost, with genetic models of the formation of the principal industrial

Mr. Norris reports that analy­ ses of some of the sedimentary rock near Playa Real show a small amount of manganese, and this fact has led those in charge of the mines to believe that the mineral was leached out of the overlying rocks by descending waters and concentrated at lower levels.

This chapter lists all basic chemical characteristics of the element Mn and the area of its application. In nature, manganese is concentrated in various manganese rocks of sedimentary and hydrothermalsedimentary genesis consisting predominantly (> 50%) of manganese minerals (Mn content—15–20% and greater); commonly this term is used in the literature as a synonym for manganese ore.

Manganese ore bodies occur in a variety of forms and in varying depths. Purely surficial deposits are confined to the lateritic types, although here also some deposits are known to persist for some depth. The major surface indication of the presence of manganese ore is the presence of float ore.
