## Abrasive Particles Used for Grinding Wheels Industries Metallurgy
ADVERTISEMENTS: Abrasive particles used for grinding wheels are of two types viz.: 1. Natural Abrasive and 2. Artificial Abrasive. Generally for most of the purposes, natural abrasives are not used due to certain advantages of artificial (manufactured) abrasive. Natural Abrasives: These are produced by uncontrolled forces of nature. The following are the generally found and [.]

As soft computing techniques are more and more widely used in machining process, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has become an effective way to construct predicting model in grinding process. The present paper reviews the efforts made in recent two decades on modeling grinding process via ANN in a sequence as input and output parameters, ANN topology and the details of the ANN training algorithm.

No chemicals, preservatives or artificial drying machineries are used. Coconut Oil is extracted traditionally by grating or grinding Copra. Now a days, the process of Coconut Oil extraction is done by crushing Copra to produce Coconut Oil, and the byproduct is known as Cake. Two types of Copra namely milling and edible are made in India.

In preparing copra, the dried meat of the coconut, the nuts are cut in half, the milk drained off, and the nuts are exposed to sun. The partially dried meat contracts and can be readily removed from the shell. Further drying reduces the moisture to under 8 percent, necessary to prevent mold growth. Artificial heat is often used for this.
