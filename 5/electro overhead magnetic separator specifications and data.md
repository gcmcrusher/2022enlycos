Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates nonmagnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron, nickel, and cobaltcontaining minerals) and paramagnetic.
