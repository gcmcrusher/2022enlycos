## The Environmental Impact of Spodumene Mining
The spodumene moves to a dryer and kiln that operate at about 1,000°C. This process converts the mineral into an easytoextract form using acid. This stage in the process also has the potential to release chemicals in the environment, some of which can be attributed to the fuel quality, calciner design, and emission abatement steps.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

ESG in Mining: Mining, by its very nature, has an impact on the environment. Critics have also not shied away from accusing the sector – fairly or unfairly – of political corruption, neocolonialism, and child labor. Apart from financial factors, investors have increasingly started paying attention to how sustainable and ethical a business is.

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

In general, ore can be divided into three types: sulphide ore, iron ore and gold ore. The types of ore differ among other things in how they are processed, their composition and their general environmental impact. Sulphide ore consists of sulphur compounds. Sulphide mineral is mineral comprising sulphur compounds.
