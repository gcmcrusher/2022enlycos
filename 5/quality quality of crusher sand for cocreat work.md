In order to improve the quality of aggregates, limestone, dolomite and other materials with medium hardness and low SiO2 content are the first choice for the raw materials for aggregate processing. Second, choose hard and brittle stones such as granite and tuff. Try not to choose rocks with high compressive strength, toughness and abrasiveness
