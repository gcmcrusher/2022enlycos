More About this Item. This sieving machine is ideal for separation, fractioning, and particle size determination of powders, catalysts, construction materials, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and spices. A jet of air gently disperses the particles on the sieve, which helps to prevent the particles from clumping and constantly cleans the sieve mesh.
