## Sugar processing: growing, milling, refining
Sugar is made in the leaves of the sugar cane plant through the natural process of photosynthesis. Energy from the sun transforms carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. The excess energy which the plant doesn't need is stored as sugar in the form of a juice found in the plant's fibrous stalks. Growing sugar. With adequate rain and

2. At the sugar mill, the sugar cane stalks are washed and cut into shreds. Huge rollers press sugar cane juice out of the shredded stalks. 3. The juice is then clarified, concentrated and crystalized. 4. The crystals are spun in a centrifuge to remove the liquid and produce golden raw sugar. • Sweet fact: Raw sugar is 96–98% sucrose.

Milling Clarification: The process involves removing impurities from the sugar cane or sugar beet juice. It is mostly done by adding lime to it to neutralise the organic acids present in it. The solution is later heated up to 95℃. The heating helps in coagulation and the impurities settle in the bottom, which is then removed.
