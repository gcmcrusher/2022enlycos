The selection of an appropriate binder type and dosage is of critical importance in producing good quality pellets at a reasonable price. Binders accomplish two very important functions in iron ore pelletization: .

for the heat transfer, the model must bebuilt upin steps.Heat transfer to a bed of iron ore pellets is therefore examined numerically on several scales. In an earlier work by Burström et al. [6] a continuous model was compared against a discrete Voronoi discretization model showing that mean values can be approximated with a 1D model. Here a full

conventional reduction of iron ore pellets by extemal gases. Thereaction has to be performed at high temperatures and, as it is an endothermic reaction, with a high heat load. In this way, heat transport from thesurroundings to pellet surface and then heat conduction from the surface to the inner parts of the pellet becomeoneof the

The heat for drying and preheating is supplied by the gases discharged from the rotary kiln, and hot air from the cooler is utilised in the rotary kiln. What is Pelletization? The process of Pelletization helps converting Iron Ore Fines into "Uniform Size Iron Ore Pellets" that can be fed in the blast furnaces or in the DRI kiln (DRI).
