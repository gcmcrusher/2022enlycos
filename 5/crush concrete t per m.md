## Using Recycled Concrete Aggregate Specify Concrete
Crushed concrete has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first, since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more costintensive in terms of labor.

Crushed concrete aggregates are pieces of old concrete buildings, roads, and other destroyed concrete structures that are crushed in a crushing machine. This crushed material is then washed clean, then broken up into smaller fragments. The fragments are added to other materials, including virgin concrete, to create recycled aggregate.

Example 1: Convert 50 t to m¬≥ (Water). Solution: Converting from metric tons (or tonnes) to cubic meters is very easy. We're going to use the formula : cubic meters = metric tons (or tonnes) / density of the ingredient The density of water is 1 g/cm¬≥ So, m¬≥ = 50 / 1 m¬≥ = 50 Therefore, 50 metric tons (or tonnes) converted to cubic meters is equal to 50 m¬≥.
