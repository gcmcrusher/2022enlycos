## Ethanol Production Dry versus Wet Grind Processing
While dry milling is less capital intensive, it also yields less ethanol per bushel of corn than wet milling (Rajagopalan, et al., 2005). Wet milling involves steeping the corn for up to 48 hours to assist in separating the parts of the corn kernel. Processing the slurry separates the germ from the rest of the kernel, which is processed further

## Dry Ball Mill VS Wet Ball Mill: What Are the Differences and How to Choose?
The wet ball mill has the following features: strong adaptability to materials, continuous production, large crushing ratio, easily fineness adjustment, high grinding efficiency, and low requirements for ore moisture content. In addition, the material transportation device is simple, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than dry ball mills.
