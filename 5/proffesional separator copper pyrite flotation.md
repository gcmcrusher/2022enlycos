## Froth flotation Wikipedia
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and wastewater treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

The copper pyrite is the most widely distributed copper mineral and the most important raw mineral material for copper smelting. The copper pyrite is brassily metallic while the power is greenish black. The copper pyrite with 3.5~4 moh's hardness and 4.1~4.3 specific gravity often exists in many kinds of copper ore deposits in states of dense

A freshly polished pyrite slab was Cu activated for 15 min in 10 − 5 M copper nitrate solution at pH 5 in N 2 purged (for 30 min) and pH adjusted (using sulphuric acid) milliQ water. N 2 was used as the conditioning gas as it has been shown to be beneficial for pyrite Cu activation and flotation (Shen et al., 2001). Solution Eh and pH were

1. Introduction. As an important metal raw material, copper is widely used in the fields of daily necessities, industries, and national defenses (Schipper et al., 2018).Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is the primary source of commercial copper metal and it is often associated with pyrite in ore deposits (Ignatkina et al., 2018).In order to obtain highpurity copper concentrate, froth flotation is
