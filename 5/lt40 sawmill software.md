## How To Saw Logs into Lumber WoodMizer USA
Similar to cant sawing, plain sawing begins with rotating and sawing the outer sides of a log into boards until the center is squared into a foursided cant. Instead of leaving the cant as is, it is rotated and sawn to produce the maximum amount of lumber. If needed, the boards are then edged by sawing the rough edge off.

## What to Know Before You Buy a Woodmizer Sawmill The Balance Small 
Certain features of the manual Woodmizer sawmills don't make much sense. The crank feed system on the LT 15 and LT 28 sawmills is an unnecessary feature. It would be easier to push the saw head through the cut rather than turn a crank that pulls the saw head through. Turning this crank puts stress on the operator's shoulder, increasing fatigue.
