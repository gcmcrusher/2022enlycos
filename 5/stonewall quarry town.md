## STONEWALL QUARRY PARK What to Know BEFORE You Go Tripadvisor
Quarry Park is a pretty park in Stonewall with plenty to offer. There is a great trail through the forest with nice views of the quarry along the way and is a good place to go for a walk or jog. A small lake is in the centre of the park which the pathway encircles as well.
