The most rapidly growing class of flotation machine is the column machine, which is, as its name implies, a vessel having a large heighttodiameter ratio (from 5 to 20) in contrast to mechanical cells. This type of machine provides a countercurrent flow of air bubbles and slurry with a long contact time and plenty of wash water.
