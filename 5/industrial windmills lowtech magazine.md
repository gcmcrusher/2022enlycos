## Wind Powered Factories: History (and Future) of Industrial Windmills
Only in the 1700s and 1800s, when windmill technology really caught on, more accurate inventories appear. In 1750, there were 6,000 to 8,000 windmills in the Netherlands, in 1850 there were 9,000 of them. For comparison, this is almost 5 times as much as there are wind turbines in the Netherlands today (1,974 turbines as of September 2009).

## Heat your House with a Water Brake Windmill Resilience
The Water Brake Windmill. Heat generating windmills convert rotational energy directly into heat by generating friction in water, using a socalled "water brake" or "Joule Machine". A heat generator based on this principle is basically a windpowered mixer or impeller installed into an insulated tank filled with water.

It was an industrial revolution entirely powered by renewable energy – something that we can (and do) only dream of today. Wind and water powered mills were in essence the first real factories in human history. They consisted of a building, a power source, machinery and employees, and out of them came a product.

The first practical windmills were panemone windmills, using sails that rotated in a horizontal plane, around a vertical axis. Made of six to 12 sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water. [9] These windmills are recorded by Persian geographer Estakhri in the 9th century as being operated in Khorasan (Eastern Iran and Western

Windmills with wood gearings had an efficiency of only 39 percent. The use of castiron (and later iron) did not only improve the efficiency of the gearwork, but also allowed for the construction of larger windmills. The use of wood limited the diameter of the sails to around 30 meters – already common in the 1600s.
