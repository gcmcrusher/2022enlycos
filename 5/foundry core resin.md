## EPA1 Furan resin binder for foundry moulding and core sand 
In the prior art, costs are reduced in furan resin binders by replacing some of the furfuryl alcohol by cheaper ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, but experience has shown that this impairs the curing properties. According to the invention, the furfuryl alcohol and, if desired, also some of the urea/formaldehyde components of such binders are partially replaced instead by inexpensive
