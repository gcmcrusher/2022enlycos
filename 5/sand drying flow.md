Shooting. In the shooting process a blow head filled with sand is pressurized with air, leading to the fluidization of the sand which results in a "fluid" consisting of an air/sand/binder mixture. This fluid flows from the blow head through shooting nozzles into the core box, repelling the air out of the box through venting nozzles.

As a result, friction causes the dry sand to jam. If the sand in the tube is wet, the water initially acts like glue, causing individual grains to bind together, just as in a sandcastle. But if sufficient force is applied, the bonds between grains are broken and the water acts as a lubricant, causing the sand to flow more easily.
