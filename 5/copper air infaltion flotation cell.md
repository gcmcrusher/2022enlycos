## These aspects influencing flotation cell effect should not be ignored!
The capacity of flotation cell is improved too. If the air inflation is over large, the flotation surface is easy to turn, which causes it unable to form a stable foam layer and influences the mineral particles floating. If the air inflation is too small, the fewer bubbles are, the slow the flotation speed is, the lower flotation capacity is.

## Flotation Cell Design: Application of Fundamental Principles
In mechanical cells there are two modes by which air is introduced into the cells; one is the forced air entry mode carried out using a blower and the other is the selfinduced air entry mode, in which air is sucked into the cell by vortexing. The two cell designs can be distinguished by the difference in vertical location of the impeller in
