Mills Grinding. Generally ball mills are more common than Rod mills or Sag Mills, there are other types of mills available such as Vertical mills but the last three mentioned are by far the most common. Ball and mills use steel balls or ceramic balls as their grinding media. Rods mills as the name suggest use rods as their grinding media.
