If the particles are too large, unwanted accessory minerals cannot be separated from the ore. The ore concentrate obtained only has a low purity. Overgrinding, on the other hand, results in high milling costs and low throughput as well as an increased need for chemicals in flotation. Furthermore, flotation cells are sensitive to solid overloading.

Rougher Flotation Cells are usually placed on the beginning of the flotation circuit of mineral concentration process . In this stage the bulk of the gangue is removed from the ore. The aimed minerals will be concentrating in the froth. These concentration froth will be sent into the cleaning flotation cells for getting the concentration with

REAGENTS USED IN FLOTATION OF GOLD ORES. Conditioning agents are commonly used, especially when the ores are partly oxidized. Soda ash is the most widely used regulator of alkalinity. Lime should not be used because it is a depressor of free gold and inhibits pyrite flotation. Sodium sulphide is often helpful in the flotation of partly oxidized
