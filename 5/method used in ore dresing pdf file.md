explanation. "Runofmine" ore is a mix of valuable minerals and worthless rock in which each ingredient is priced separately. Run ofmine ore is treated in the dressing plant and processed into different concentrates. Where the ore contains more than one metal of value, separate concentrates of, for example, copper, zinc, and lead are produced.

16.2.2 Concentration or Dressing of the Ore Generally, the ores are found mixed with earthy impurities like sand, clay, lime stone etc. These unwanted impurities in the ore are called gangue or matrix. The process of removal of gangue from powdered ore is called concentration or ore dressing. There are several methods for concentrating the ores.

The copper ore mined from a deposit has a copper content of about 1 %, and is refined to a copper concentrate with a grade of about 20 to 40 % through a process called ore dressing, including crushing and polishing. This copper concentrate is then smelted in a refinery to raise the copper grade to nearly 99 %.
