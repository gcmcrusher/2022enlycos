## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid overgrinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

CERAMIC LINED BALL MILL. Ball Mills can be supplied with either ceramic or rubber linings for wet or dry grinding, for continuous or batch type operation, in sizes from 15″ x 21″ to 8′ x 12′. High density ceramic linings of uniform hardness male possible thinner linings and greater and more effective grinding volume.

accomplished by any of three processes: the dry process, the wet process, or the semidry process [10]. In a dry cement manufacturing process, dry raw mix contains less than 20% moisture by mass. However, in a wet process water is added to the raw mix to form slurry and then is transported to the kiln [11].

## Manufacturing the cement kiln Understanding Cement
The dry process is much more thermally efficient than the wet process. Firstly, and most obviously, this is because the meal is a dry powder and there is little or no water that has to be evaporated. Secondly, and less obviously, the process of transferring heat is much more efficient in a dry process kiln. An integral part of the process is a
