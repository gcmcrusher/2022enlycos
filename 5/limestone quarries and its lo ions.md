## Crushed Stone: The Unsung Mineral Hero Geology
Crushed stone is the world's most basic mineral commodity. It is abundant, widely available, and inexpensive. It is a material that people are familiar with in almost all parts of the world. In 2020, the United States produced a total of about 1.46 billion tons of crushed stone [1].

The beads have other ions attached to them, usually sodium ions, but sometimes hydrogen ions instead. When the water passes through the ion exchange column, the calcium and magnesium ions in the water swap places with the ions in the ion exchange column, helping to remove hardness. Many laundry detergents also contain water softening agents.

The porous limestone of Sóskút is a Miocene sedimentary rock, and it has a few variations in terms of its mineralogy and fabric (Fig. 2A).The typical microfabric is an ooid grainstone/packstone (Török, 2002) which was used for our tests.This limestone occurs in two formations: Tinnyei Limestone Formation (Sarmatian) and Rákosi Limestone Formation (Badenian).

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

Description. Limestone often contains variable amounts of silica in the form of chert or flint, as well as varying amounts of clay, silt and sand as disseminations, nodules, or layers within the rock.The primary source of the calcite in limestone is most commonly marine organisms. These organisms secrete shells that settle out of the water column and are deposited on ocean floors as pelagic
