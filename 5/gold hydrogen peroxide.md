The myth that hydrogen peroxide damages gold may have come from the thought that hydrogen peroxide reacts with all metals. However, this is not true. While hydrogen peroxide can react with metals, it does not easily react with stable metals like gold and silver. Besides, hydrogen peroxide does not react with metals under normal conditions.
