BAT reference documents. BAT reference documents (BREFs) represent the outcome of the 'Sevilla process'. The majority of BREFs cover specific agroindustrial activities; such BREFs are referred to as 'sectoral BREFs'. However, there are also a number of 'horizontal BREFs' dealing with crosscutting issues such as energy efficiency

•In vertical mills, milling cutters with solid shafts are usually used. Milling cutters with keyed holes are predominantly for use in horizontal mills. End mills are designed for cutting slots, keyways and pockets. Two fluted end mills can be used to plunge into work like a drill. End mills with more than two flutes should not be plunged into the

The vertical milling machine is a precision tool used for shaping and fabrication by the removal of stock typically from metallic work pieces. Plastics and other materials can also be machined on the mill depending upon tooling and material. Mill controls may be manually operated, computer numerical controlled (CNC), or a combination of both.

In reference to milling machines, the distance, measured in feet or meters, that a point on the cutter's circumference will move in one minute. In reference to lathes, the distance the work moves past the cutting tool, expressed in feet per minute or meters per minute. Measuring is done on the circumference of the work.

## Milling (machining) Wikipedia
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.
