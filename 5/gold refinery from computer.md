## How much Gold is in a Computer Desktop or Laptop? SD Bullion
The answer varies depending on the ewaste recycling source and computer board components. We believe it conservative to say with today's gold price, over $10 of gold gets layered in an average computer. In other words, 1/5th of a gram of gold can get pulled or withdrawn from an average computer's interior.

The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a dor√© bar or scrap. Dor√© bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, dor√© bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.
