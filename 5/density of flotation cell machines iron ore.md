To answer your question I think it's best to consider the anatomy of forced air vs. induced air (e.g. WEMCO) flotation cells. The induced air flotation cell has the rotor position at the top of the cell as it needs to be close to the surface to pull in air; hence the majority of the mixing energy is dissipated in the top of the cell.

Frothers are usually added to the pulp just before its entrance into the flotation machine. The quantity of frother varies with the nature of the ore and the purity of the water. In general from .05 to .20 lbs. per ton of ore are required. Some frothers are more effective if added in small amounts at various points in the flotation machine circuit.

Hematite is easier to floated than magnetic, which could be separated by positive flotation. As the density of iron ore is much higher than that of gangue mineral, gangue mineral is more likely to attach to the foam than iron ore. Therefore, for the extraction of iron ore, reverse flotation is more advantageous than positive flotation.
