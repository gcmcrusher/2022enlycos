I have a Steel Mill that is supplied with coal and iron. There is a train that is supposed to take the steel to a river, then it's taken up river by ship and then moved by trucks to a Machine Factory. For some reason, the Steel Mill will not put the produced Steel in the train station. All of the buildings are close enough and the entire line for steel is complete, even selling in the city.
