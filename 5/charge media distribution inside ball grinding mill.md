When charging a grinding mill, the standard practice is to dump tons of balls into the mill at once and replace them somewhere between once a shift and once a week. It's an inefficient practice that wastes energy, impacts product particle size distribution and risks breakage of mill linings and grinding media.

We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media. While the mill is stopped, the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.
