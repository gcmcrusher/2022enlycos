When sifting for kief, many will use a series of screens with consecutively smaller holes to further refine their kief with each screen.

## A proper full melt dry sift tutorial. This time the right way.
Love my Dry Sift Wizard Screens! This was from a second or third (I dont remember) sift off some Chocolope trim with no cleaning at all. I am no sift master only used the screens a handful of times but I will be sifting all my trim from now on instead of blasting it.

## Dry Sift HASH: What are best screen sizes? Rollitup
May 28, 2014. #1. I know 70 Microns is the most popular / with bubble hash guys, but Im looking into building some stuff for dry sift. No way Im going to separate all my glands through ten different screen sizes. Looking for the best sizes for dry sift. I was thinking 120micron for separation and a 70 for refining. What are some views on this.
