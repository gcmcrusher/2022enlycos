Internalcooling technology is an effective cooling method to reduce the temperature in grinding zone and avoid grinding burn for grinding hardtocut materials. In order to overcome the technological difficult problems generated by grinding heat in grinding process, such as pull, burns, and surface bonding, a novel method of pressurized internalcooling was proposed to strengthen the heat
