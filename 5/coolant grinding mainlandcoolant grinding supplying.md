Internalcooling technology is an effective cooling method to reduce the temperature in grinding zone and avoid grinding burn for grinding hardtocut materials. In order to overcome the technological difficult problems generated by grinding heat in grinding process, such as pull, burns, and surface bonding, a novel method of pressurized internalcooling was proposed to strengthen the heat

Sasahara et al. [] developed a cuptype vitrified bonded grinding wheel, as is Fig. 2(a) showed, which can provide coolant from the inside of the grinding wheel and carried out the experiment of grinding CFRP.Results found that the grinding temperature and surface roughness were reduced. Peng et al. [] prepared two pressurized internal cooling grinding wheels with a dismountable abrasive ring.
