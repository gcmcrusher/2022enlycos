The Reading Rare Earth Magnetic Drum (RED) uses a unique 5 pole magnetic element to generate a field intensity in excess of 0.7 Tesla on the drum skin. The magnetic element design affords the maximum field gradient and the 5 poles enables additional cleaning of the magnetic stream. This gives a very selective separation at high throughputs compared to alternative magnetic separators.

## Gravity Separation System,Equipment,Method Prominer (Shanghai) Mining 
The DMS process involves the mixing of a preprepared ore stream with a dense medium of selected specific gravity (SG) in a mixing box and passing this mixture through a dense medium cyclone (DM cyclone). It is here that separation of the high and low SG fractions of the ore occurs. Prominer's DMS modular plants are available with throughput

The gold nanoparticles of the formed complex catalyzed the hydrogen reduction reaction, and the generated current was used as an analytical signal. Our results show the possibility of the simple and rapid detection of the S. flexneri and B. cereus strains at very low numbers of 3 cells/mL and 12 cells/mL, respectively.

## Magnetic and Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Devices
The unique properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), coupled with versatile surface engineering techniques, have led to a rising class of screening methods that enable magnetic separation of specific biomoieties. The magnetic interaction also allows targeting specific organs by using steady magnetic field gradients. 2 2. M.
