Iron ore pellets are small and hard spherical particles agglomerated from a fine iron ore concentrate. They are used in the blast furnace process to produce hot metal. The diameter of blast furnace pellets is usually between 8 and 16 mm. In this study, a batch of magnesia iron ore pellets was first sieved into particle sizes of 8–10 mm, 10–12.7 mm, 12.7–16 mm and 16–20 mm
