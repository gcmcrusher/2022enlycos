## Colloid Mill, Pharmaceutical Machinery
Colloid Mill [66] Colloid mill is a machine that is used to reduce the particle size of a solid in suspension in a liquid, or to reduce the droplet size of a liquid suspended in another liquid. This is done by applying high levels of hydraulic shear to the process liquid. Colloid mill is frequently used to increase the stability of suspensions

## Colloid Mill: Operating Principles, components, Uses, Advantages
Colloid mill is a machine used in the disintegration of solid particles or droplet size of a liquid present in suspension or emulsion. The machine consists of an inlet (which is subjected to a tremendous shearing action that effects a time dispersion of uniform size) and an outlet. Colloid mill works on the rotorstator principle.

A colloid mill is a machine that is used to reduce the particle size of a solid in suspension in a liquid, or to reduce the droplet size in emulsions.Colloid mills work on the rotorstator principle: a rotor turns at high speeds (2000 18000 RPM).A high level of hydraulic shear [clarify] stress is applied on the fluid which results in disrupting and breaking down the structure.
