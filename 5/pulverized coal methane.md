## Experimental Investigation of Pore Structure Damage in Pulverized Coal 
To study the effect of pulverization on coal's pore structure and the implications for methane adsorption and diffusion properties, three kinds of high volatile bituminous coals were sampled and crushed into six kinds of particle sizes to conduct the experiments using a combination of proximate analysis, N2 (77 K)/CO2 (273 K) adsorption pore structure characterization, and highpressure
