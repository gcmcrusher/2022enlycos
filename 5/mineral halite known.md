## Halite DISCOVER LIFE'S PRECIOUS GEMS!
Halite is known as an evaporate mineral. Evaporates are minerals that are found in sedimentary deposits of soluble salts resulting from the evaporation of water. The two types of evaporate deposits are marine or ocean deposits and nonmarine, which are found in standing bodies of water such as lakes.
