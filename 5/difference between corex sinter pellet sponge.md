## The Direct Reduction of Iron ScienceDirect
That is partially due to the more consistent quality of pellets and sinter. Also, with the advent of DR pellet coatings, lump becomes the weak link preventing highertemperature operation in shaft furnaces, since they are more likely to produce fines during reduction, which play an integral role in clustering of pellets.

## Iron ore pricing explained Fastmarkets
Sinter fines and lumps make up the bulk of the seaborne iron ore market, and are the products most frequently traded on a spot basis, so daily pricing is used for the key 62% Fe, 58% Fe and 65% Fe fines, and lump premium references. By contrast, the beneficiated ore segment comprising pellet and concentrate is smaller in terms of both

The emission levels with the Corex process are much lower than the BF route of production which consists of blast furnace, sinter plant and the coke ovens. Corex process emits at least 15 % less CO2 as compared to BF route for hot metal production. The air emissions are also lower than the conventional BF units.
