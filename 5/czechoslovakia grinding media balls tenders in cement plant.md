## Ball mill upgrade cuts energy consumption by 25%
At a cement plant, there are a number of pathways to achieve this. But one of the most important is the adoption of technology that reduces energy consumption, while preserving – or even increasing – production: the addition of a hydraulic roller press (HRP) to a ball mill circuit is a proven example of what can be achieved in this regard.
