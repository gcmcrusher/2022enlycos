The size of a jaw crusher is measured by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 48" x 42" jaw crusher measures 48" from one crushing jaw to another and is 42" across the width of the two crushers. The primary applications for using jaw crushers are: Crushing different kinds of ore; Reducing building rubble to pieces

Table Source: Wikipedia (Crushers) Cone crushers use a spinning cone that gyrates in the bowl in an eccentric motion to crush the rock between the cone surface, referred to as the mantle, and the crusher bowl liner.Gyratory crushers are very similar to cone crushers, but have a steeper cone slope and a concave bowl surface. As the gap between the bowl liner and the mantle narrows, the rock is

Typically, jaw crushers produce less fine material than impact crushers. The reduction ratio of a jaw is approx. 4 to 1. Fines are necessary to meet certain gradations and increase material compaction. This is the reason why a jaw crusher is predominenatly used as a primary crusher for an intial reduction in size or to produce a nonspec material.

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
