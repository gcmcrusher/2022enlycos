Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles. These spindles are fully covered with resistant mantle and a manganese bowl liner covers the hopper. Rocks get squeezed at the same moment when it enters in between the bowl liner and

Cone crushers take on the strenuous task of crushing large rocks into a smaller size. Essentially, they operate like compression crushers. The liners of the cone crusher are crucial for protecting the mantle and the concaves inside the compression chamber from wear and tear. These are easily replaceable parts and have to be switched out often to maintain optimal performance.

Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
