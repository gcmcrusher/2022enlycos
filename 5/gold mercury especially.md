## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem ThoughtCo
First, mercury is mixed with the materials containing gold. A mercurygold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury, leaving behind the gold. This process does not result in gold that is 100%

Ormolu (/ ˈ ɔːr m əl uː /; from French or moulu, "ground/pounded gold") is the gilding technique of applying finely ground, highcarat gold–mercury amalgam to an object of bronze, and for objects finished in this way.The mercury is driven off in a kiln leaving behind a gold coating. The French refer to this technique as "bronze doré"; in English, it is known as "gilt bronze".
