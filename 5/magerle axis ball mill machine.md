It's cons we determined are worse. Due to the design, the X axis typically causes a large X axis footprint of the machine. Very roughly, machine width minimum becomes a little more than [x table width 2 times X travel] and that typically results in the footprint of these machines being very large or rather very wide.

A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

Abstract. Fiveaxis ballend milling is used extensively to machine parts with sculptured surfaces. This paper presents the general cutting dynamics model of the ballend milling process for machine tools with different fiveaxis configurations. The structural dynamics of both the tool and workpiece are considered for the prediction of chatter stability at each tool location along the tool
