grinding the reference and test ore with the same particle size distribution under the same grinding conditions. Typical feed load and mill speed in practice were used in order to make the grinding environment as close as possible to that in large scale grinding. The Bond's work index of Baban Tsauni (Nigeria) ore was found to be 11.52kWh/tonne.

## Iron ore Wikipedia
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Determination of Work Index for Iperindo Lode Gold Deposit at Ilesha 
The work index of reference ore was used to calculate the work index of the test ore using Gaudin Schuman expression to obtain a work index of 11.92kwh/ton for test ore. This work index value obtained for Iperindo gold ore (test ore) lies favorably within the work index of 8 – 16.5kwh/ton for gold ore sighted in the literature.
