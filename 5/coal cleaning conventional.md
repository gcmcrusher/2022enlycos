## What is coal? U.S. Geological Survey
Coal is a sedimentary deposit composed predominantly of carbon that is readily combustible. Coal is black or brownishblack, and has a composition that (including inherent moisture) consists of more than 50 percent by weight and more than 70 percent by volume of carbonaceous material. It is formed from plant remains that have been compacted, hardened, chemically altered, and metamorphosed by
