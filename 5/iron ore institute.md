Iron is the fourth most abundant element of Earth's crust and one of the best studied micronutrients in nutrition science (1, 2). It is a key element in the metabolism of all living organisms. Iron exists in two biologically relevant oxidation states: the ferrous form (Fe 2) and the ferric form (Fe 3 ).

"Middlings" get crushed to smaller size until the iron bearing material is separated from the noniron material. The process makes lump and sinter ores for the steel industry with a practice known as 'scram mining'. The company started trial operations out of the former Magnetation/ERP Iron Ore plant near Coleraine, Minn., in 2019.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
