## What Mineral Is Used To Create Iron Ore Realonomics
The only pure iron known to exist naturally comes from fallen meteorites. .Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 9294% iron and 35% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.
