## PCB Assembly Process Explained The Complete Guide
The PCB design process is where the PCB is first conceptualized. Engineers create a blueprint for the contacts and how the PCB should be layered. The design process takes into account various factors like the dimensions of the components, their orientation, the type of PCB (singlesided, doublesided, etc.) and even the soldering process.
