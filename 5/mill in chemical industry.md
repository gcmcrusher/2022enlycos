## Pulp mill Wikipedia
A pulp mill is a manufacturing facility that converts wood chips or other plant fiber sources into a thick fiber board which can be shipped to a paper mill for further processing. Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semichemical, or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or nonbleached, depending on the customer requirements.
