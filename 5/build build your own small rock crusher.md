## Rock Crusher info wanted Smokstak® Antique Engine Community
Last weekend we were out driving around looking for old tractors and engines and I found a rock crusher, it is on a cart, it has about 36" dia. spoked flywheels with about a 24" dia. pulley, it has a chain conveyor in the back to take the rock out. Does anybody have any info on rock crushers or picture's.
