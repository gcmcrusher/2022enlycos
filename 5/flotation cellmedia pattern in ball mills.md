Mill Internals. As with rod and ball mills liner designs for autogenous and semiautogenous mills have been in a state of flux for a number of years. Operators continually search for optimum designs. Each mill application and each liner material coupled with varying mill diameters will produce a different internal wear pattern.

Many older operations have rod mills in combination with ball mills. Ball mills are a similar shape to that of the rod mills except that they are shorter with length to diameter ratios of 1 to 1.5. As the name implies, the grinding media in these mills are steel balls. The particles size of the feed usually does not exceed 2.5 cm.

## nextSTEP™ Rotor Stator FLSmidth
When compared to other forcedair flotation designs, the nextSTEP mechanism exhibits stronger air dispersion near the rotorstator region, higher air holdup and a stronger pumping effect below the rotor. CFD analysis shows that the nextSTEP mechanism generates a preferred slurry flow and positive froth movement pattern near the top of the tank.

In flotation, four concentrates were collected after cumulative times of 0.5, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 min at an air flow rate of 2.5 dm 3 min − 1. The flotation froth was scraped every 10 s. In all flotation tests, a low froth height (< 1 cm) was used so it was assumed that the froth recovery was virtually 100% in all cases. 2.3. Techniques2.3.1.

Semi autogenous grinding eliminates the need for a secondary crushing circuit. Rod and ball wear, the principal maintenance cost of traditional grinders, is also eliminated with this method. Rod mills are usually designed to grind normally minus 35 mm feed to minus 3 mesh. They are tumbling mills with a length to diameter ratio of 1.5 to 2.0.

The hydrocyclone was fed from a divided sump by a Vacseal pump. The pump served as a receptacle for both the ball mill discharge and the hydrocyclone overflow and, as mentioned, the feed. The Vacseal pump was charged from a bottom outlet from this coneshaped sump and the rougher flotation circuit was fed from an overflow near the top of the sump.
