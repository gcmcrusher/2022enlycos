Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand–lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.
