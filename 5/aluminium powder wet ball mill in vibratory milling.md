Figure 21 (a) and 21 (b) show the microstructure of an aluminumironcerium alloy and a transmission electron micrograph of oxide dispersion

## An Investigation of the Use of Stearic Acid as a Process Control  IPEN
Highenergy ball milling is a powder process that has a great potential on control the of elemental powders of commercial purity aluminum (Alcoa), niobium (FTI – CBMM) and nickel to each sample of 10 g, e.g., 0.1 g (1.0 wt. %), 0.05 g (0.5 wt. %) and 0.033 g (0.33 wt. %). Samples were milled in a vibratory ball mill (Spex 8000

## Ball milling as an important pretreatment technique in lignocellulose 
In vibratory ball mills, the vessel or reservoir containing the lignocellulosic biomass and the grinding balls is shaken at high vibrational frequencies up and down. The mass ratio of the grinding ball to the biomass powder is another milling parameter that should be considered in ball milling pretreatment . Zhang et al. used two ratios of
