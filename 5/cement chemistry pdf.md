## Cement Chemistry an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Cement chemistry can affect the dispersion efficiency of superplasticizers in various ways. One of these is through the ionic composition of the aqueous phase and in particular through the amount of soluble sulfates. The milestone paper on this subject comes from Yamada and Hanehara (2001).As explained in Section 7.3.1 on the reversibility of polymer adsorption, they made alternative additions

The amount of blast furnace slag is usually in the range of 80 to 85 % (not less than 75%), while calcium sulphate is added in the amount of 10 – 15%. Overall, the SO3 content of this cement is controlled to be always greater than 4.5%.
