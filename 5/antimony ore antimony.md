## Antimony Statistics and Information U.S. Geological Survey
Antimony is chalcophile, occurring with sulfur and the heavy metals, lead, copper, and silver. Over a hundred minerals of antimony are found in nature. Stibnite (Sb 2 S 3) is the predominant ore mineral of antimony. The most important use of antimony metal is as a hardener in lead for storage batteries.

## Antimony Ore MSquare Mining
The antimony ore found in our mine is Stibnite, which is a sulfide bearing ore and is concentrated using a froth flotation process. Typical output is min 20% Sb for roasters, min 25% Sb for blast furnace smelters and min 45% Sb for liquators that melt the antimony sulfide in a reducing atmosphere.

Antimony is a silverywhite metal that is found in the earth's crust. Antimony ores are mined and then mixed with other metals to form antimony alloys or combined with oxygen to form antimony oxide. Little antimony is currently mined in the United States. It is brought into this country from other countries for processing. However, there are companies in the United States that produce antimony

Antimony is a minor ore of the element antimony, although most antimony comes from antimony compounds (namely Stibnite), which are much greater in abundance. Antimony has a very interesting property: It is similar to water, in that instead of contracting when it solidifies, like all other matter, it expands. For this reason, it is useful

Applications. The native antimony itself is not a main antimony ore, most of the metal is recovered from stibnite (Sb 2 S 3) and significantly less from other ores like Sbrich tetrahedrites, Sbrich sulfosalts, stibarsen and few others.. Most of the antimony is used in flame retardants in plastic products and some special materials like flame resistant paints and resins.

If the temperature is any higher, the stibnite volatilizes into oxide. This method is used to upgrade lowgrade ores.
