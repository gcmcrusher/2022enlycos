The roller milling, or "high grinding" method slowly replaced most existing traditional stone mills. With roller milling, steel rollers quickly explode the grain over a series of passes through the mill. The reground flour is thoroughly sifted to remove the bran and germ, thereby also removing some of the nutrients.

A healthy grinding. The heart of the stone mill is the millstone. The size of the millstone is not decisive for the fineness of the flour. However, the optimal combination of the millstone's diameter and its speed, controlled by a threephase motor, is fundamental. The combination of rotation speed and gap between stones ensures perfect milling at low temperature to avoid damaging the gluten.
