## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid overgrinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

## Wet Grinding VS Dry Ball Mill Grinding
The ore charge in the tests shown in table 18 would probably be small because the mill, which was 19 inches in diameter, had an 8inch discharge. Wet grinding gave 39 percent, more capacity and 26 percent more efficiency than dry grinding. These values supplement those shown in table 16.

Wet ball mill is a kind of equipment which uses grinding medium and a certain amount of liquid (water or anhydrous ethanol) to grind materials. Unlike dry ball mill, wet ball mill adopts the wet grinding method. The characteristic of wet grinding is that the material needs to be soaked in the liquid for grinding. This method can effectively reduce the chance of the material properties changing
