## Coal Ratio an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Nondiesel transport with crushing and belt conveying of coal and overburden are being envisaged to save on oil consumption. Cheaper blasting agents like site mixed slurry, are being introduced to reduce the cost of blasting. For 2/1 tetralin/coal ratio conversions in the tubing bomb increase with temperature both for 1 and 2 hours reaction

## How can I calculate the coal generators and water extractors? reddit
Coal generators need 15 coal per minute each. If you can get 120 coal per minute from a node (Normal Mk2, Pure Mk1) that can sustain 8 coal generators. 8 x 75W = 600MW output per 8 coal generators. The preferred ratio of water extractors is generally 3 water extractors to 8 coal generators, with everything running at 100% but you need to be

## Micro shape of coal particle and crushing energy ScienceDirect
Fig. 3. Microscopic observation images of fine coal particles below 0.075 mm diameter produced by crushing specimens through sudden release of high pressure gas. The shape of these coal particles in Fig. 3 is almost the same as that of coal particles shown in Fig. 2, i.e., mostly spherical or ellipsoidal. 3.3.
