Ammonium sulphate is probably the most extensively used inorganic nitrogeneous fertilizer. In the soil, it reacts with clay & humus, forming an insoluble ammonium complex. Ammonia in the complex is then converted into nitric acid by bacterial action during 710 days, and the latter forms calcium carbonate.

Uses. The primary use of ammonium sulfate is as a fertilizer for alkaline soils.In the soil the ammonium ion is released and forms a small amount of acid, lowering the pH balance of the soil, while contributing essential nitrogen for plant growth. The main disadvantage to the use of ammonium sulfate is its low nitrogen content relative to ammonium nitrate, which elevates transportation costs.
