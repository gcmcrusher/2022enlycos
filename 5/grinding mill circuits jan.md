Grinding coarse ore in a ballmill is done by steel balls of three sizes (5, 4, and 3 inches); fine ore is ground in a tubemill by 2 and 1½inch balls or by flint pebbles or by hard, rounded mine rock such as quartzite. These grinding media wear to small sizes, and new ones must be added regularly to make up the weight.

The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry, which goes to the ball mills for further grinding, and coarse pebbles/rocks, which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits, the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the

## An Improved Control Strategy for Ball Mill Grinding Circuits
An improved control strategy is proposed to control ball mill grinding circuits for energy saving and pollution reduction. A twolayer optimization architecture combined by particle size optimization layer and energy optimization layer is developed, where the optimal particle size setpoint is calculated first, followed by the energy optimization step.
