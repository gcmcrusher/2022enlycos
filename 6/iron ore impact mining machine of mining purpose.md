## What Are the Benefits of Mining? – Research Summary
Mining is the practice of extracting ore, coal, clays, soils, or minerals from the ground for the purpose of using them. Mines have existed for thousands of years. In ancient times mines consisted of short tunnels dug into the sides of hills or mountains where veins of metals, minerals, or coal had been discovered on the surface.
