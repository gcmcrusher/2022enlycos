Mechanic ball mill machines are designed for fine grinding, mixing, and preparing a small volume of materials, which feature high efficiency, low noise, and small batches. A planetary ball mill consists of two or four grinding jars which are arranged eccentrically on a socalled sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars.
