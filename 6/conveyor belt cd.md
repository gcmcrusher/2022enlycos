The root cause of Conveyor belt deviation is that the external force on the belt is not zero in the direction of the belt width, or the tensile stress perpendicular to the belt width is not uniform, resulting in the counterforce on the belt from the rollers or rollers, etc. to produce a parting force to one side, which causes the belt to deviate to one side under the action of this parting force.
