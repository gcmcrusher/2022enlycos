## Tube and pipe basics: How to achieve the perfect bend
The roller effectively "compresses" the tube against the central bend die. This method is most common in symmetrical workpieces—those with identical bends on either side—often bent in one setup on a machine with two bending heads. This method works well for tubes bent to a CLR that's at least three times the tube OD.

What matters is that you have sufficiently large crosssection (size of the duct, if you will) that can handle that airflow. If you consult the duct sizing chart here for flex and round ducts, you can see that for 2000 CFM airflow, you can choose a 20inch metal round duct or either 36×10inch or 30×12inch rectangular duct.
