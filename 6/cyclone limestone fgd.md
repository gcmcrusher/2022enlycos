Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) is a very common method for gas claning adopted in a gas processing plant. In this process, the flue gas with acid vapors is scrubbed to remove it as a byproduct. Most of the FGD processes use alkali to scrub the flue gas. Many designers of FGD adopt the limestone gypsum process.

## Mitsubishi Power Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Plants
The flue gas desulfurization (FGD) plant removes sulfur dioxides (SO 2) from flue gas produced by boilers, furnaces, and other sources. Mitsubishi Power effectively contributes to the prevention of air pollution through its wet limestonegypsum FGD process and seawater FGD process, and both processes can treat a large range of SO 2

The FGD technology is based on a chemical reaction that occurs when the warm exhaust gases from the coalfired boiler come into contact with limestone. This reaction removes 90% of the sulphur dioxide from the flue gas and converts the limestone into calcium sulphite. after passing through a bank of cyclone thickeners, becomes the feed

availability of limestone for FGD and also the use of its byproduct, FGD gypsum. Limestone is an abundant resource in India with total reserves of 200 billion tonnes. India's limestone production has been growing steadily and it is among the world's largest producers with 338 million tonnes of limestone produced in 2017–18.

## Suitable FGD limestone mill, low investment in power plants
The limestone powder for FGD is a minimum of 90% passing 325 mesh. Transportation: deliver the limestone to the power plant in a closed tank car, sent into the limestone powder bin by a hydraulic cyclone. Pulping: mix the limestone powder with water in the limestone slurry tank placed under the bin to make qualified limestone slurry.
