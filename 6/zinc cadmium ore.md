Most commercial cadmium is obtained as a byproduct of zinc ore refining, though cadmium can also be recovered from recycled materials such as nickelcadmium batteries and metal scrap. The United States is the world's primary producer of cadmium, generating an estimated 1,100 tons of the metal per year.
