## 2022 Gravel Prices Crushed Stone Cost (Per Ton, Yard & Load) HomeGuide
Steel Slag Rock Cost. Steel slag costs $25 to $39 per ton or $35 to $54 per yard, depending on the quantity ordered and size of stones. Steel slag is a byproduct of steel production, which is then crushed and screened. Steel slag is best used in drier climates. Steel slag comes in limited colors from lightgrey to various shades of charcoal.

Aiming at hardtoreuse gasification fine slag, a new process of treating gasification fine slag by classification was presented. The screening treatment was carried out based on ensuring the original particle size composition of fine slag, and it was divided into six particle size ranges as follows: 0.5, 0.30.5, 0.1250.3, 0.0740.125, 0.0450.074, and 0.045 mm.
