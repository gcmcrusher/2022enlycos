Hybridisation caused by anthropogenic movements of animals is a conservation concern. Blackfaced impala (Aepyceros melampus petersi) are endemic to northwestern Namibia and southwestern Angola and are geographically isolated from common impala (A. m. melampus). Common impala have been translocated into the blackfaced impala range creating a hybridisation risk. We validated 13

Another study of R. microplus in a region of northern South Africa assessed acaricide resistance in combination with genetic diversity (Robbertse et al., 2016). The frequency of mutations potentially resulting in acaricide resistance was evaluated using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that contribute to acaricide insensitivity.
