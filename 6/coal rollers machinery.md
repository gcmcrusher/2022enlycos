## Rolling coal Wikipedia
Rolling coal is the practice of modifying a diesel engine to emit large amounts of black or grey sooty exhaust fumes—diesel fuel that has not undergone complete combustion. A predominantly North American based phenomenon, rolling coal is sometimes used as a form of antienvironmentalism. Such modifications may include the intentional removal of the particulate filter.
