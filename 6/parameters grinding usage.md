It's simpler than we might think. A grinding operation is a system, and as a whole, there are many parts to consider. One key component is the wheel. To determine where to start, consider the seven operational factors. The Material Being Ground. The Severity of the Operation. Required Finish and Form Accuracy.

## Machining 101: What is Grinding? Modern Machine Shop
Grinding takes an abrasive — often attached to a wheel — and uses its many grains to cut a workpiece. Variations on this process are useful for a wide variety of applications. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove
