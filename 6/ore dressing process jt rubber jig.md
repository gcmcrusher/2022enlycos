Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

When the manganese ore is selected by combined gravity and magnetic separation, the magnetic separator mainly processes the ore particles with a diameter of less than 1mm. When conducting magnetic selection, the permanent magnetic separator machine is generally used. The above is the manganese ore gravitymagnetic separation process flow.

Concentration. Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill. In largescale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated. These properties can be colour (optical sorting), density (gravity separation
