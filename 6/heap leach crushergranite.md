2.1 Leaching. Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flatsurface, 3–10m high, 10 4 –10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1–5kg Cum −3.

Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and reseparate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the
