Rock sand making machine uses a unique rockonrock crushing process. This crushing action grinds and mills the feed material to produce a high quality, cubical product with no contamination from wear parts. As the material fed into the grinds and impacts against itself, the typical wear cost per tonne of material processed is very low.
