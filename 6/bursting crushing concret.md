Hydraulic bursting, crushing and splitting breaks up concrete structures by applying lateral forces against the concrete, and represent methods which are able to be used in most situations. However, rather than shattering the concrete into bits as impact tools would, the lateral forces build up over time to crack the concrete into smaller sections.

Concrete bursting is a demolition method which involves drilling small holes into a concrete structure. An expanding mechanism is then inserted into these holes, and pneumatically expanded, causing the concrete to fracture. This results in smaller sections of concrete which can then easily be cleared.
