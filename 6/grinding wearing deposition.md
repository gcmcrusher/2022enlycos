Abrasion is the wearing away of rock by grinding action. 35. Glacial Deposition When a glacier melts, it deposits the sediment it eroded from the land, creating various landforms. Till mixture of sediments that a glacier deposits directly on the surface. Moraine is the ridge of till at the farthest point reached by a glacier. 36.

## The effects of deposition parameters on the grain morphology and wear 
Under various deposition parameters, the HPHT diamond seeds grow into single crystal grains, MCD clusters and NCD clusters. the NCD grains grown at 900 °C may also have outstanding potentials in grinding in terms of wear resistance and high temperature performance. Although the single crystalline diamonds have the extreme hardness,
