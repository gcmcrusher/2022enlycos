## The Phase Inversionbased CoalCO₂ Slurry (PHICCOS) feeding system 
The proposed Phase Inversionbased CoalCO₂ Slurry (PHICCOS) feeding system uses supercritical CO₂ with liquidlike density to feed pulverized coal into a highpressure EFG. The challenge of preparing the coalCO₂ slurry is addressed using phase inversion: a phenomenon associated with the hydrophobicity of liquid CO₂coal mixtures.

## Feed Coal an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Loss of a coal feeder causes raw coal feed to associated puverizer to shut off. Since in a direct firing system, fuel is fired according to the requirement of the steam demand and reserve fuel in a pulverizer is very limited, a loss of feed will cause unbalance in operating pulverizer/s, thereby impairing the furnace stability.

The coal is first crushed into minute particles using equipment called pulverizes. The main function of the Primary air fan or PA fan is to carry the pulverized coal to the furnace as fuel for combustion.

A stoker stove is an automatic coal burning unit, wherein some type of stoker mechanism feeds fresh coal to a burning fire at a feed rate set by the user. Air is generally forced through the fire from the bottom by a blower or by a flue mounted draft inducer. The coal stoker stove operates on much the same principle as the pellet stove.
