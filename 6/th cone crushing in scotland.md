Cone Crusher CrossSection. The spring cone crusher design is able to pass uncrushable materials e.g. tramp metal, through the crushing cavity by using springs. The first hydraulic cone crusher was developed in 1948 and this allowed for the opening of the crushing cavity hydraulically, instead of using springs (mechanical actuation). Both the

A statement from Sandvik said, "A key attribute of the QH331 is the advanced design of the CH430 cone. "It possesses a longer and steeper crushing chamber than other comparable models. The material therefore remains in the crushing chamber longer, optimising reduction and providing a superior product shape.

Avoid trickle feeding the crusher. Try not to trickle feed a cone crusher. In addition to causing poor cone crusher productivity and product shape, trickle feeding has an impact on bearing alignment within said crusher. A crusher should be operated above 40% but below 100% rated horsepower in order to maximize cone crusher productivity and to

## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action. At a given point on the concave, material is
