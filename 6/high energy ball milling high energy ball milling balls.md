## HighEnergy Ball Milling and Sintering of Ti2Ta22Si11B and Ti6Ta 
The milling process of elemental Ti2Ta22Si11B and Ti6Ta22Si11B (at%) powder mixtures were performed in a planetary Fritsch P5 ball mill using stainless steel vials (225 mL) and hardened steel balls (19 mm diameter). Balltopowder weight ratio of 10:1 and a rotary speed of 300 rpm were adopted, varying the milling time. Wet milling (isopropyl alcohol) for 20 more minutes was used to
