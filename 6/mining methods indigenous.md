Revegetation of the abundant mining sites is also a method for reclamation of the mining sites which is done mainly in two ways. Either the native plant species suitable for the existing soil and site conditions are grown, or the soil and site are made suitable to facilitate the growth of particular species of plants.

## What are the main methods of mining? American Geosciences Institute
There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and insitu mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels, beach sands, or other environments.

There are many types of mining methods and some of them include surface and subsurface mining. Surface is the most common method around the world. In the Philippines, most of the minerals are low grade ores, so surface mining is favoured. Mining has caused an uproar of issues with the indigenous people.
