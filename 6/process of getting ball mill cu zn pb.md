## The Attentions of Ball Mill Grinder Installation and Commission
Start the lubricating oil system and cooling water system. Turn on the power of the ball mill, press the accident button to stop it, and check the main bearing, motor, and gears to determine whether the direction of rotation of the ball mill is correct. If there is no abnormality, start the ball mill to run for 8 hours.

## Tin Ore Mining Process Xinhai
For a certain tin ore dressing plant, Xinhai has taken flotationgravity process by smashing raw ore to 200mm, and a closecircuit grinding by grinding it to 200mm occupied 60~ 65% . Process of "one roughing two scavengingone cleaning" has been applied to the flotation to grind copper and sulfur separately to 0.074mm occupied 95%.
