## Milling – fritsch
The quality of every product or material analysis depends on the quality of the sample preparation. It is therefore extremely important to consider all the individual milling parameters in order to make an informed choice: material properties, feed size and volume of the sample, grinding time and desired final particle size, any abrasion of the grinding parts – all these factors are significant.

Most sawmills use machines like mechanical ring cutters to strip each log of its bark. Others use waterjet blasters. Whatever method they employ, sawmills keep the bark waste to use as landscaping mulch or to fuel the kilns. In the debarking stage, a circular saw will buck or crosscut logs into the correct lengths.

Newer CNC mills rather use climb milling. The features of climb milling are: The cutting chip decreases in thickness, causing heating of the chip rather than the workpiece. The cutting surface is cleaner, resulting in less rubbing and an increase in tool lifespan. The chips fall behind the cutter, reducing the problem of a polluted cutting path.
