The product of uranium mining is normally uranium oxide concentrate – U 3 O 8 – which is shipped from the mines in 200litre drums. This is barely radioactive, but has chemical toxicity similar to lead, so occupational precautions are taken similar to those in a lead smelter. Most of the radioactivity from the ore ends up in the tailings.

Underground and surface mining of uranium ores is generally like the mining of other types of ore. However, in situ leaching is specific to uranium and comprises more than 50% of uranium production. It involves the circulation of groundwater fortified with oxygen and a chemical additive that may be either slightly acidic or slightly alkaline.
