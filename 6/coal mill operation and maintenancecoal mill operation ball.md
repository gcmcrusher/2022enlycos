The ball mill was incorporated into a test system as shown schematically in figure 2. Fuel oil burned with stoichiometric quantities of air, produced both inert sweeping gas and heat for mill operation at elevated temperatures. A heat exchanger was used to heat any desired mass flow of sweeping air or inert gas to temperatures up to 700° F.
