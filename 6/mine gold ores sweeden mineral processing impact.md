Of the world's largest iron ore producers, only LKAB mines underground. Work in the tunnels is automated and remote controlled. The deeper down the mine extends, the better the quality of the ore has proved to be. A new mine level is currently being built at a depth of over 1000 m. The challenge is not so much mining the ore, but transporting it.
