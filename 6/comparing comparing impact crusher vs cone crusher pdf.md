Primary crushers are designed so that the maximum size that can be presented to the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4 :1 and 9 : 1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3 :1 to 10 :1.
