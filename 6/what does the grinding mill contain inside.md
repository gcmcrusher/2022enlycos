Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills, for grinding wheat or other grains. They are sometimes referred to as grindstones or grinding stones.. Millstones come in pairs: a convex stationary base known as the bedstone and a concave runner stone that rotates. The movement of the runner on top of the bedstone creates a "scissoring" action that grinds grain trapped between the stones.

The overall reach of an end mill, or length below shank (LBS), is a dimension that describes the necked length of reached tools. It is measured from the start of the necked portion to the bottom of the cutting end of the tool. The neck relief allows space for chip evacuation and prevents the shank from rubbing in deep pocket milling applications.

## Ball Mill: Is the Grinding Fineness the Finer, the Better?
In the entire beneficiation process of a concentrator, grinding operation cost accounts for a considerable proportion. The grinding fitness is one of the main factors affecting the mineral processing index,which will directly affect both the grade of concentrate and the recovery rate of product. Therefore, how to improve grinding fineness of the ball mill becomes an important part of

## Mill Speed an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Media mills are the most widely used machines for fine grinding of powders. These machines contain individual loose grinding elements—the grinding media—which can consist of balls, rods, pebbles, beads, etc. The action of the mill leads to motion of the media elements, which collide with each other and with the walls of the grinding chamber.

The amount of grinding done and the fineness of the product depend on the rate of feed and the length of the tube, as well as on the hardness of the ore. According to Gruessner, at the Hannan's Star Mill, Kalgoorlie, the ore from two No. 5 dry ball mills was treated wet in a tube mill 16 feet 5 inches long and 3 feet 11 inches in diameter.

A mill is a device, often a structure, machine or kitchen appliance, that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g., via a hand crank), working
