## GANSG Mining and smelting Iron Ore and other metals IGG
Mining and smelting Iron Ore and other metals. Metal ores are mined in a variety of ways, lead, tin and zinc have all been recovered using drift and shaft type mines whilst open cast mining is a feature of British iron ore mining. Iron Ore Mines. By the time the railways came along iron ore was the most important mineral being mined.
