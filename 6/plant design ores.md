The geological grade of the ore deposit is relatively high (about 50%), but the ore body is thinner or has more interlayers. The waste rock is mixed in during mining to dilute the ore. For this kind of ore, only crushing and nogrinding can be used so coarsegrained tailings are discarded through reelection to recover the geological grade.
