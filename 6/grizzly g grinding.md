The morphospace within which you can find bear skulls and jaws is bounded by a brown line containing a brownshaded filling; a space denoted by the bears' family name: Ursidae. Bear skulls occupy the corner typified by a combination of being wide, domed towards the back, with shorter canines, and with dentition otherwise better adapted to grinding.
