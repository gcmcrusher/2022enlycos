## Chromite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Chromite mining in Turkey started in 1850; since then, Turkey has had an important role in the world chromite market. Turkey produces chromite ore and ferrochrome. It is estimated that Turkey has produced about 45 metric tons of chrome ore. Chromite production is mainly exportoriented. Turkey has one chrome and two ferrochrome chemical plants.
