The concentration of H 2 O 2 increases as the ore gets finer likely in response to an increase in particle surface area. In a previous study, Xia et al., 2016a, Xia et al., 2016b reported pulp chemistry changes in pH, oxidation reduction potential and dissolved oxygen with increasing grinding

Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.
