Considering concrete density = 2400 kg/cum, One bag of cement and other ingredients can produce = 400/2400 = 0.167 Cum of concrete (1:2:4) 01 bag cement yield = 0.167 cum concrete with a proportion of 1:2:4. 01 cum of concrete will require. Cement required = 1/0.167 = 5.98 Bags ~ 6 Bags. Sand required = 115/0.167 = 688 Kgs or 14.98 cft

## In 1 cum how many number of 50kg cement bags required
Jan 12, 2021. #9. The density of cement is 1440 Kg/Cum. Thus the volume of a 50 kg cement bag comes to be= [ 50/1440 ]1000 = 34.722 Litres . For practical purposes consider as 35 Litres. That gives to 0.035cum quite simple. Thus in 1 cum it come approx. 29 bags of 50kg cement bags. Santhosh Veerabathini.
