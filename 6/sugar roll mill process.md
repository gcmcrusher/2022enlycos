So sugar was harming even people who didn't eat the stuff years before the 'mass sugarisation' of the modern world. The Sugar Making Process. The slaves picked the ripe sugar cane by hand using machetes, loaded it into carts where it was taken to the sugar mills. During harvesting season the mills worked 24 hour days to process the crop.
