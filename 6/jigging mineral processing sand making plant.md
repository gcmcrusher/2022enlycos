The grade of SiO2 in quartz sand decreases with the finer grain size of quartz sand, and the grade of impurity minerals is the opposite. This phenomenon is especially obvious in quartz sand containing a large number of clay minerals. Therefore, the quartz sand ore before the selection is carried out. Washing and deslipping are very necessary.
