The ore is then passed through a primary single toggle jaw crusher, which will produce a 173mm product. The crushed ore is loaded onto a conveyor which includes metal detectors to detect the presence of tramp iron. The crushed ore is then passed through two vibrating feeders and two double deck banana vibrating feeders.

Limonite is a hydrous iron oxide ore, which is formed after the weathering of other ores, and is the most widely distributed in nature, but it is rare to find a large amount of ore deposits. Its chemical formula is nFe2O3·mH2O (n=1～3, m=1～4). Limonite is actually a mixture of goethite (Fe2O3·H2O), hydrogoethite (2Fe2O3·H2O) and iron
