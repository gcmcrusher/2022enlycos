1. Ball mill. a Ball mill has a wide range of applications. It can grind metal ore and nonmetal ores, which is suitable for hard materials, such as quartz, gold ore, copper ore, iron ore, potash feldspar, etc. b Ball mill is also can be applied in the industries such as cement, construction materials, fireproofing materials, glass, and ceramics.

## Rod Mills Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Rod Mills use low cost grinding media. Less power is required since grinding rods are not cascaded and operate at lower peripheral speeds. Higher grinding efficiency is obtained since there is less void space in a rod charge compared to any other grinding media. This also results in lower steel consumption.
