Solids are filtered to remove excess water, which can be reused in the circuit. The solid copper concentrate is then sent to the smelter. Smelting. High temperatures further purify the ore in a series of smelting steps. The copper concentrate is first placed in the smelting furnace to be heated up to 1260 °C and converted into molten liquid.
