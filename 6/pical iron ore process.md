The smelting reduction process (Corex, Finex) is a combination of direct reduction and smelting process to produce molten pig iron, the quality of which corresponds to blast furnace pig iron. The ore is first reduced to sponge iron in a twostage process and subsequently melted with coal and oxygen to form pig iron.
