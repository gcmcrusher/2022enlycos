## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Pre19th century placer mining operations used mercury to dissolve the gold in crushed ore, making it easier to recover. Later innovations include the MacArthurForrest Process and borax flux extraction. However, one of the most interesting methods is froth flotation. Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules.
