## All About Gypsum – Uses, Properties, Color, and Worth
Gypsum is considered an evaporate and forms when evaporation of water allows oxygen to bond with the surrounding sulfur to create sulfate. The sulfate will then bond with surrounding calcium and water to create the final product gypsum. Gypsum has the following properties: Mohs Scale Hardness : 1.5 – 2. Specific Gravity: 2.31 – 2.33.

## Gypsum Mineral Uses and Properties Geology
What is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.

## Effect of clays, limestone, and gypsum on soluble oil flooding
Abstract. Clay and gypsum greatly reduce the oil recovery of the solubleoil polymer flood, while limestone has virtually no effect. Gypsum dissolves in flooding solutions and liberates calcium ions which affect the soluble oil flood in two ways: (1) precipitate some of the petroleum sulfonates, and (2) reduce the viscosity of polyacrylamide solution, which causes an increase in mobility and

## Difference Between Gypsum and Limestone
The key difference between gypsum and limestone is that the calcium sulfate is the main constituent in gypsum whereas calcium carbonate is the main constituent of limestone.. Limestone and gypsum are minerals that form from calcium salts; limestone contains calcium carbonate while gypsum contains CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O. However, their properties and usages are different from each other.

Gypsum is a fertilizer product and supplies the cropavailable form of calcium (Ca 2 ) and sulfur (SO 4 2). If these forms are deficient in soil, then crop productivity will benefit if gypsum is applied. This is a big "if" for Iowa soils.

Gypsum can be spread with lime and litter spreaders. Gypsum is not acid soluble and will not change the soil pH.

Dolomite often forms when limestone recrystallizes after burial. Many limestones are biochemical; some may be chemical (inorganically precipitated). Evaporite rocks form when sea water or lake water dries up and precipitates gypsum (CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O), halite (NaCl), or other minerals. Evaporites are chemical sedimentary rocks.
