The procedure was repeated through a roll setting of 1.6 mm and a 1.67mm screen. The combined coarse mica from the three screens comprised 41% of the feed weight and contained 4.9% of the tantalum and 7.9% of the niobium. This lost tantalum and niobium was considered part of the mica lattice rather than unliberated material.
