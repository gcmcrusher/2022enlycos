A United Nations working paper of 1995, on gold mining in Zimbabwe, estimates over 5000 small scale gold mines. This variety has increased considerably seeing that this closing have a look at and an estimate of deposits will honestly be in excess of 10 000.

## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and SmallScale Gold 
Background: In 2017 around 1419 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and smallscale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and smallscale gold miners in Zimbabwe.

## Alternatives to mercury use in smallscale gold mining
In Zimbabwe elemental mercury is used in artisanal and smallscale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with goldcontaining materials, resulting in the formation of the mercurygold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process is very dangerous and can lead to significant mercury exposure with serious environmental and health risks.
