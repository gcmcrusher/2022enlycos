Adjustments to the lifting plates around the circumference of the mill provide greater lift and drop and thus greater efficiency. SAG mills are often used as regrinding mills after a fully autogenous milling. Thus giving them a lower efficiency as they are grinding very small rocks to start with. Also depends on the medium in the mill.
