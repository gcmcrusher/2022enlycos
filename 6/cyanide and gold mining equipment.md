Abstract. In gold mining, cyanide has been the preferred lixiviant worldwide since 1887. Although cyanide can be destroyed and recovered by several processes, it is still widely discussed and examined due to its potential toxicity and environmental impact. Biological treatment of cyanide is a wellestablished process and has been commercially

Process. Cyanide can be used to extract gold, either in a controlled mill environment, or more crudely on rock piles in the open. Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water. The cyanide binds to the gold ions, and makes them soluble in water, thereby allowing separation from the rock.
