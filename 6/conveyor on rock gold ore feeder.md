In 1970, South Africa's output accounted for 79% of the world's gold production. The largest producing gold mine in the world, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia, is primarily a copper mine. Gold ore processing in placer mines, the gold is recovered by gravity separation. For hard rock mining, other methods are usually used.

The process of gold ore processing and production mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the threestage closedcircuit crushing is more modern and suitable for highhardness gold ore crushing, which can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation, thereby improving the

1.1 ORE FEED HOPER: consists of a large hopper designed to feed the ore to the rest of the hard rock plant plant. The hopper, in a hard rock, usually allows for dry feed of the rocks to the plant. It is designed for a direct feed by earth moving equipment. The size of the feed will depend on the plant's capacity (Tons Per Hour).

There are a number of conveyors required to ensure that following crushing, rock is transported to its correct destination. The largest conveyor on site (the overland conveyor) transports the ore from the open pit to the processing plant, and the waste rock to the waste rock embankments. Transfer stations move rock from one conveyor to the next.
