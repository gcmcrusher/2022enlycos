## Rule Of Thumb Size Reduction Milling This Week in Fedora
Tubular Ball Mills ScienceDirect. Jan 01, 2016 A crushing plant delivered ore to a wet grinding mill for further size reduction. The size of crushed ore F 80 was. 4.0 mm and the S.G. 2.8 tm 3. The work index of the ore was determined as 12.2 kWht. A wet ball mill 1 m 1 m was chosen to grind the ore down to 200 m.

Ball mill or pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine used for size reduction of the particles. Ball mill manufacturers intend each model with a hollow cylinder which constitutes balls; mounted over a metallic frame so that it can be turned along its longitudinal axis. The balls with different diameter occupy 3050% of the mill volume.

Ball mills also tend to have a greater reduction ratio as well as a lower rate of reduction, thus making them more preferable over other kinds of mills [2]. But like any of the other mills, as previously mentioned ball mills have a very low efficiency in terms of utilizing the energy generated towards particle size reduction.

The ball mill differs from the tube mill by being short in length; its length, as a rule, is not far from its diameter (Fig. 2031). Feed to ball mills can be as large as 2.5 to 4 cm (1 to 1a in) for very fragile materials, although the top size is generally 1 cm (a in). Most ball mills operate with a reduction ratio of 20 to 200:1.
