1. Introduction. Yang et al. has analysed Instantaneous cutting forces on ball end milling and developed the cutting force model using orthogonal machining data. Lee et al. predicted cutting forces in 3D using the geometry and kinematics of the ball nose end milling. Feng et al. developed the cutting force mathematical model and analysed the cutter run out to estimate the empirical parameters

The milling process – definitions Cutting speed,v c Indicates the surface speed at which the cutting edge machines the workpiece. Effective or true cutting speed, v e Indicates the surface speed at the effective diameter (DC ap).This value is necessary for determining the true cutting data at the actual depth of cut (a p).This is a particularly important value when using round insert cutters

Our "Surface Finish" calculator is really our most powerful calculator by far. It's actually two seperate calculators but most of the time we only use the second one. The first one takes an end mill with a corner radius milling up a slope and outputs the radius of the scallop that it creates. This phenomenon is better explained on the
