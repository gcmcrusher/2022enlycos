Wet Ball Mills are Ball Mills that are used widely in the ore beneficiation industry,as well as the building material industry such as glass.. During the producing phase, the material and water are mixed together to grind in the ball mill. Under the effect of the flowing water,the material will get a better flow ability so the processing capacity will be higher.

Accordingly, during the wet ballmilling processes, the effect of the rolling friction of balls on the wet ballmilling behavior may be small. Therefore, the rolling friction may be neglected in this analysis, but the sliding friction plays a critical role. (aluminum oxide, Al 2 O 3) and PTFE. The computational load in the simulation was
