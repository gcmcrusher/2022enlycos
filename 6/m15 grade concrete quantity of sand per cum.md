Arbitrary Method of Proportioning Concrete. The general expression for the proportions of cement, sand and coarse aggregate is 1 : n : 2n by volume. 1 : 1 : 2 and 1 : 1.2 : 2.4 for very high strength. 1 : 1.5 : 3 and 1 : 2 : 4 for normal works. 1 : 3 : 6 and 1 : 4 : 8 for foundations and mass concrete works.

## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand & Aggregate in M20, M15 
Solution: In case of M10 concrete, the ratio of cement, sand and aggregate is 1 : 3 : 6. Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete × 1.54. Hence, the dry volume of concrete is = 3 × 1.54 = 4.62 m 3. The required quantity of cement is = (Cement ratio ÷ Sum of all ratio) × Total volume of concrete = = 0.462m 3.

## A Complete Guide of Concrete Grade
The mix proportions ratio of concrete details the proportion of cement, sand and water it needs to make that particular strength of concrete. For example M20 grade of concrete is the mix ratio 1:1.5:3. The "1" is cement, "1.5" is fine aggregate and "3" is coarse aggregate. This mix applies to all grades of concrete.

## How To Calculate Cement, Sand And Aggregate Quantity In Concrete
Grade of Concrete Mix = M15 (Cement = 1 : Sand = 2 : Aggregate = 4) Sum of the ratio of Cement, Sand & Aggregate = 124 = 7. First we have to find the Dry Volume of Concrete by Increasing the Wet Volume by 54 percent. Dry Volume = Wet Volume x (54% of Wet Volume) = 1 x (54 x 1 / 100) = 1.54 Cubic Meter. Now we have to find the quantity of
