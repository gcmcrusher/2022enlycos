BALL CLAY. Ball clays are kaolinitic clays that commonly consist of 20–80% kaolinite, 10–25% mica, 6–65% quartz, as well as organic matter. Ball clay is formed from the weathering and transportation by water of parent rocks. Seams in the same deposit will vary in composition, depending on the quantity of the principal and accessory minerals.

## Ball clay Wikipedia
Ball clays are kaolinitic sedimentary clays that commonly consist of 20–80% kaolinite, 10–25% mica, 6–65% quartz.Localized seams in the same deposit have variations in composition, including the quantity of the major minerals, accessory minerals and carbonaceous materials such as lignite. They are finegrained and plastic in nature, and, unlike most earthenware clays, produce a fine

Conclusion. Ball clay can be used as an effective adsorbent for the removal and recovery of Cd (II) from aqueous solution. The adsorption properties of ball clay were comparable to other previously studied natural clays. Adsorption of Cd (II) was pH dependent and the maximum adsorption occurred at pH 6.

The raw bentonite clay is mainly composed of Al and Si hence the name alumino–silicate. The relatively high concentration of Fe 2 O 3, MgO, CaO, Na 2 O and K 2 O are an indication that these are the main exchangeable cations in the bentonite clay matrices. This correlates with the CEC results for (Mg, Ca, Na and K) ().Insignificant levels of P, Cr and S were observed as major component.
