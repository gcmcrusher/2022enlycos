Recovery of gold from waste boards is a simple process, and so is the gold recycling process; Gold finishes can tolerate high temperatures; Gold plating involves electroplating gold on the copper pads. However, the precious metal cannot react with copper ions directly. Therefore, it is essential to electroplate a nickel layer first, then
