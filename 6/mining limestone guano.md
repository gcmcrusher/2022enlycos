Guano mining was still being conducted (it was highly sought after in most caving areas in Australia where there was a large population of bats), but there were disastrous outcomes. In 1975, there was a large colony of small bats using Johannsen's Cave (part of Limestone Ridge), and in some areas, guano had almost filled the cave to the top.
