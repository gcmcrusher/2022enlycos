## About Mining and Minerals Bureau of Land Management
Since 1920, the Federal government has leased fuels and certain other minerals, charging a royalty on the value of the mined and sold material. Today, minerals that are subject to lease include oil and gas, oil shale, geothermal resources, potash, sodium, native asphalt, solid and semisolid bitumen, bituminous rock, phosphate, and coal.
