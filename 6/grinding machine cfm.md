## Most Common Air Tool Pressure Requirements CFM Chart Vital Hand Tools
The horsepower will let you know the power of the air compressor's motor, and CFM will tell you the air compressor outputs to your air tools. There is a recommended CFM requirement given by the manufacturer of every air tool. Take the highest CFMrated tool and multiply it by 1.5. if you buy an air compressor that can provide that much CFM

For example, let's say your team uses the same air compressor to power a ½" drill that requires 30 CFM and a grinder that requires 60 CFM. If you use these tools simultaneously, you will add 30 CFM 60 CFM for a total demand of 90 CFM. You would likely need an air compressor that can reliably produce 90 CFM of air when choosing equipment.
