Calcium intake slightly reduced blood pressure, especially in those under 35 years of age. The benefits depended on the dose: 1,000 to 1,500 mg dropped blood pressure around 1 point, and over 1,500 mg, almost 3 points [ 15 ]. You may discuss with your doctor if calcium carbonate may be helpful in your case.
