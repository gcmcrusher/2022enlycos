Foundation, about 17 m x 10 m x 2.5 m, is supported on Piles (750 mm dia, 20 m long). Piles are so located so as to yield minimum foundation eccentricity. Eccentricity achieved is less than 0.3% both along width and length of the foundation. Mill Operating speed is about 15 rpm, Pinion and Gearbox about 150 rpm, Motor about 1000 rpm.
