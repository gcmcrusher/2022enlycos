Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander.

To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravellike material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
