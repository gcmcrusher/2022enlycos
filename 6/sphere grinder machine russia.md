The 3headed sphere machine is designed to cut from 3 sides and allows for slightly larger spheres to be cut than the standard 2headed machine. If you intend on making smaller pieces, consider the material. If it is precious material you might consider the more timeconsuming Small Sphere Machine. This machine makes small, marblesized spheres.

## Techniques for Collectors : Small sphere grinder
Around 1977 I bought a used, commercial sphere grinder. It was painted in Lortone green. Its construction was very simple. Two AC motors mounted opposite each other, but at 20 degrees off axis. The sphere holders were one half inch cast iron pipe with 2.0 inch cast iron caps. I was always amazed that I could produce a sphere from that setup.
