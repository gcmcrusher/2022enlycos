## REPORT Opportunities abound in Slovakia Euromines
After its 'velvet divorce' with the Czech Republic in 1993, Slovakia was seen as having little chance of strong economic development, but this was wrong. In 2007 it had the highest GDP growth in the EU, and the second highest in 2008. However, it has been hit by the economic crisis: its gross domestic product declined by 5.3% in the

We studied primary ore samples from Kalmakyr, a giant Cu–Au–Mo porphyry deposit in eastern Uzbekistan. Disseminated and stockworktype highgrade Cu–Au–Mo mineralization showed average concentrations of 55 ppb Pd, 5.5 ppb Pt, 0.95 ppb Rh, 0.49 ppb Ir, and 4.1 ppm Au (n = 8). This type of mineralization is characterized by the presence of pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and gold. A

Although reserves are limited, the Czech Republic produces significant quantities of bituminous, anthracite, and brown coal. Most of the bituminous coal is derived from the OstravaKarviná coalfield in the northeast, although it is also mined near Kladno in the Plzeň basin, as well as near Trutnov and Brno. A high proportion of the bituminous coal is of coking quality. Production of brown

Most molybdenum skarns contain a variety of metals including W, Cu, Zn, Pb, Bi, Sn, and U and some are truly polymetallic in that several metals need to be recovered together in order for the deposits to be mined economically. MoWCu is the most common association and some tungsten skarns and copper skarns contain zones of recoverable molybdenum.

Laboratory and ore analysis . Quality samples equal quality results. Taking better ore samples will produce betterquality results. This sounds easier said than done, especially in mining applications where often consignments of many thousands of tons of ore product needs to be represented by final composite ore sample sizes that wouldn't fill a teaspoon.

The Ore Mountains (German: Erzgebirge; Czech: Krušné hory) in southern East Germany at the border with the Czech Republic are closely connected to the history of uranium exploitation.The metal was discovered in a sample from a silver mine in the mountain range, and uranium was produced first as a byproduct in the early 19th century and later as a main product from the 1890s on.
