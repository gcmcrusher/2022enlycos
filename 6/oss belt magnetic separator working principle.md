7.1.1.9 Magnetic Separation. When large quantities of ferrous scrap are to be separated from other materials magnetic separation is the obvious choice. The two types of magnets are permanent magnets and electromagnets. The latter can be turned on and off to pickup and drop items. Magnetic separators can be of the belt type or drum type.

• Sulphide ore recovery and separation The success of any magnetic separation process is governed by the property of the material to be collected and the structure of the separator to carry out the process. This can be expressed in the relationship between on one side the competing forces and the magnetic force on the other.

Magnetic separation is a versatile technique used in sample preparation for diagnostic purpose. For such application, an external magnetic field is applied to drive the separation of target entity (e.g. bacteria, viruses, parasites and cancer cells) from a complex raw sample in order to ease the subsequent task(s) for disease diagnosis.

3.1. Working principle of high gradient magnetic separation. Owing to the remarkable difference between magnetic susceptibility of magnetizable wires and that of suspending medium, the magnetic field within close range of the wires is significantly distorted which sequentially induces an intense magnetic field gradient in that region [28,39].
