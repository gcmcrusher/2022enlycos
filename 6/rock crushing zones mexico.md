During crushing of such rock, the sulphides rich zones will fragment in a different way than gangue. Depending on the loading configuration, such zones may end up in an initially coarser size fraction. Subsequent, crushing of these relatively strong progeny fragments will result in preferential liberation of the copper minerals.

A cataclastic rock is a type of fault rock that has been wholly or partly formed by the progressive fracturing and comminution of existing rocks, a process known as cataclasis.Cataclasis involves the granulation, crushing, or milling of the original rock, then rigidbody rotation and translation of mineral grains or aggregates before lithification.

Hornfels is a finegrained metamorphic rock that was subjected to the heat of contact metamorphism at a shallow depth. It was "baked" by heat conducted from a nearby magma chamber, sill, dike, or lava flow. Common temperatures for the formation of hornfels range from about 1300 to 1450 degrees Fahrenheit (700 to 800 degrees Celsius).
