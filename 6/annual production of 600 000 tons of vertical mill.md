Seasonal average prices per cwt have been fluctuating. In 1990, the seasonal average price per cwt was $27.40 whereas in 2002 the price had jumped to $31.40 per cwt. Tomato prices vary greatly within a season and among years. Most of the price variation within a season is caused by weather effects on production.
