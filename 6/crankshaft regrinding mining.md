## Crankshaft Regrinding – SNZ
The main reason crankshaft grinding is done is because the crank wears over time. Over thousands of miles the end play between the crankshaft and the bearings increases. When the "fit" between the bearings and the crank is not perfect it lowers oil pressure and decreases lubricity. The less oil to the crank the faster it can wear out.
