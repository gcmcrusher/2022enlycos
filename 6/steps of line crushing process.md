A: Step 1: in recycling plastic is to separate the different types of plastics. Since most plastic has a number on it that identifies it, this is an easy task. To make separation easier, you can use magnets for plastic 1 and 2, handpick plastic 4 and 5, and so on. Step 2: Shredding. The next step is shredding the sorted plastic into small pieces.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wearresistant plate
