Effect on Recovery in OreDressing Plant. The stoping method may affect the percentage of ore minerals recovered in the oredressing plant, especially where certain sulfide ores are concentrated by flotation. Thus, a stoping method that permits immediate removal of the ore after it is broken so as to preclude its partial oxidation before it

The ores are found mixed with earthy impurities like sand, clay, lime stone, etc. These unwanted impurities in the ore are called gangue or matrix. The process of removal of gangue from powdered ore is called concentration or ore dressing. There are several methods for concentrating the ores. The choice of method depends on the nature of the ore.

## Iron ore mining and dressing tecscience
Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle, the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.

## oredressing definition and meaning Wordnik
oredressing: In mining, the mechanical treatment of ores by processes depending on physical laws and physical properties of minerals, such as specific gravity, magnetic or electric properties, etc. The principal objects of oredressing are the concentration of lowgrade ore, the purification of ores by the removal of objectionable material, and the separation of two or more useful minerals

The ore dressing process of treating poor hematite includes staged ore milling, size separating, gravitational dressing, strong magnetic dressing and inverse floating. By means of staged ore milling, early separation between iron containing mineral and gangue, returning the intergrowth to next ore milling for further separation, separating milled material based on size, gravitational dressing

## Ore Dressing Methods Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Oredressing methods fall naturally into two general subdivisions— (1) concentration methods and (2) directrecovery methods (amalgamation and leaching or wet methods). Concentration methods are employed to remove worthless gangue material and concentrate the valuable minerals of the crude ore in a smaller bulk.

The spiral classifier relies on the principle that the specific gravity of the solid particles is different, so the sedimentation speed in the liquid is different, the fine ore particles float in the water to overflow, and the coarse ore particles sink to the bottom of the tank. It is a kind of classification equipment that discharges ore
