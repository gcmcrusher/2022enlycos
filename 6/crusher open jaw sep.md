## Crushers: A Brief Guide to Crushers and Crushing Operations Thomasnet
Types of Crusher. There is an extensive range of crushing units available through manufacturers, including rotor crushers, impactors, and jaw crushers. Jaw crushers use a pair of opposing jaw plates set in a V, at the base of which is an opening for crushed material to fall through. Because of the spacing of the jaw plates, the large pieces are

It must be at least 36 in. wide for an 18 x 36 jaw crusher. So a 4ft by 8ft screen would be acceptable. The 1in. screen is a second deck for the 38 tph from the jaw crusher, so the deck correction factor is 0.90 and that screen capacity is 2.1 x 0.9 = 1.89 tph/sq ft. The screen area needed under the jaw crusher is 38/1.89 = 20.1 sq ft.
