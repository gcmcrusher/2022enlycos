## 15 Insane mining accidents Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
12. Pike River mine explosion. Four explosions killed 43 men, in what is considered New Zealand's worst mining disaster. 13. Natural gas explosion in Wayne. A massive natural gas explosion destroyed a neighbourhood in San Bruno, California, in 2010. The accident killed eight people, injured 66 others and ruined 38 homes.

After peak production in 1926, most of the mining ended by 1970; all closed by 1997. Kansas miners produced 50 percent of all zinc and 10 percent of all lead mined in the United States, carrying to the surface nearly 2.9 million tons of zinc and 115 million tons of ore. A 1977 law was implemented to return the former mines to useful productive

## Surface mining – strip, open pit, mountaintop removal, dredging
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left behind, and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.
