Jaw crushers can be divided into two basic types, single and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation, along with the toggle plate, causes a compressive action. A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates. The first shaft is a pivoting shaft on the top of

## What is a Gyratory Crusher Quarrying & Aggregates
The gyratory crusher can work continuously in a full cavity without a feeding device. It can directly feed materials to the gyratory crusher by multiple vehicles, so the production capacity is large ( t/h), the unit energy consumption is small, and the work is stable. The noise is small.

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of singlesize aggregate products – up to 40 mm in size.
