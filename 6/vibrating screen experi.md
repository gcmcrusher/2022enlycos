## How does the vibrating screen work? Haiside
The vibrating screen works by using the doublerotation vibration generated by the vibrator. The upper rotating weight of the vibrator makes the screen surface vibrate in plane, while the lower rotating weight makes the screen surface vibrate the cone surface. Its combined effect The effect is that the screen surface produces doublerotating
