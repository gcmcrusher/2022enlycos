## History of Coal in Cambria County Johnstown Area Heritage Association
The 1910s and 1920s were the most active decades for Cambria County coal mining, producing over 16 million tons of coal annually (except for 1922, when a widespread miner strike reduced the amount to about 12.9 million tons). The Great Depression impacted the industry severely, however – many smaller operators went out of business.

The crushed coal is then transported to the store yard. Coal is transported to bowl mills by coal feeders. 3. Bowl Mill. The coal is pulverized in the bowl mill, where it is grounded to a powder form. The mill consists of a round metallic table on which coal particles fall. This table is rotated with the help of a motor.

Coal formed in Ohio during the Pennsylvanian Period about 300 million years ago when the state was near the equator with a warm climate. Eastern Ohio was a lowlying coastal area that was crossed by deltabuilding streams from the rising Appalachian Mountains to the east. Vast swamps with lush vegetation dominated the coastal areas.

There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbonrich, and harder material.
