A distinct class of roll crushers is referred to as 'sizers.' These are more heavily constructed units with slower rotation, and direct drive of the rolls rather than belt drives. They have a lower profile, allowing material to be easily fed by loaders, and are a good choice for portable crushers at the mine that reduce the coal in size for conveying to the preparation plant.

Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary crushing (although impact crushers are sometimes used), which typically reduces material to about 2.5 to 10 centimeters (1 to 4 inches). The material (throughs) from the second level of the screen bypasses the secondary crusher because it is sufficiently small for the last crushing step.

## Impact Crusher Working Principle Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Impact Crusher Working Principle. Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them. Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic. An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on

In general, crushing is carried out in three stages, depending on the desired size of the material. Primary Crushing. This is the first stage of the crushing process. In general, the size of the feed material, which is between 800 and 1500 mm, is reduced to between 150 and 300 mm. Secondary Crushing. This is the second stage of crushing.

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of singlesize aggregate products – up to 40 mm in size.
