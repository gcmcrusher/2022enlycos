## 8 Types of Gold Ore Properties and Ways to Process
Once you find gold in quartz ore, you can extract gold by the flowing steps: 1 Use a sledgehammer to break the rock into smaller pieces. 2 Place a steel anvil in a large pan to prevent the loss of the gold contained in the quartz stone. 3 Look for large pieces of gold that can be collected manually or with tweezers.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

## Iron Ore Mining Techniques Metal Extraction
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

The quantity of ore mined and waste rock (i.e., overburden or barren rock) removed to produce a refined unit of a mineral commodity, its rocktometal ratio (RMR), is an important metric for understanding mine wastes and environmental burdens. In this analysis, we provide a comprehensive examination of RMRs for 25 commodities for 2018.

## Mines, Minerals, and "Green" Energy: A Reality Check
Averaged over a battery's life, each mile of driving an electric car "consumes" five pounds of earth. Using an internal combustion engine consumes about 0.2 pounds of liquids per mile. Oil, natural gas, and coal are needed to produce the concrete, steel, plastics, and purified minerals used to build green machines.
