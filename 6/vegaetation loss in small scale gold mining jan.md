## Global demand for gold is another threat for tropical forests
The current global gold rush, driven by increasing consumption in developing countries and uncertainty in financial markets, is an increasing threat for tropical ecosystems. Gold mining causes significant alteration to the environment, yet mining is often overlooked in deforestation analyses because it occupies relatively small areas.

The amalgam is typically isolated by hand and then heated—often with a torch or over a stove—to distill the mercury and isolate the gold.

In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and smallscale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with goldcontaining materials, forming a mercurygold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

In 2013, the United Nations completed the Minamata Convention on

## The Borax Method of Gold Extraction for SmallScale Miners
An obvious drawback of this method is the toxicity of mercury.2,3 The health risk of mercury is well known today in many parts of the world, but in remote smallscale mining (SSM) communities that knowledge is still scarce.4 Gold extraction by amalgamation releases large amounts of mercury into the environment as metal mercury, which is later transformed to metholated mercury, a powerful

## World emissions of mercury from artisanal and small scale gold mining 
We estimate that artisanal and small scale gold mining releases between 640 to 1350 Mg of mercury per annum into the environment, averaging 1000 Mg yr 1, from at least 70 countries. 350 Mg yr 1 of this are directly emitted to the atmosphere while the remainder (650 Mg yr 1) are released into the hydrosphere (rivers, lakes, soils, tailings).

## Nations agree on global, legally binding treaty on mercury emissions 
Artisanal and SmallScale Gold Mining. The booming price of gold in recent years has triggered a significant growth in smallscale mining where mercury is used to separate gold from the orebearing rock. Emissions and releases from such operations and from coalfired power stations represent the biggest source of mercury pollution worldwide.
