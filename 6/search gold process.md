Set the gold ore and a small quantity of lead in a cupel. Place the cupel in a blast furnace. Heat the mixture until the lead and gold ore liquefy. The blast furnace batters the cupel with hot air. The lead combines with other metals and forms oxide compounds that separate from the gold. This process works best with small quantities of gold ore.
