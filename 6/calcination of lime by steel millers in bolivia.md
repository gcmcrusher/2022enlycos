Calcium oxide, or quicklime, is defined as a white, crystalline, alkaline chemical compound which is produced in lime furnace with the help of calcination process. Calcium oxide is obtained from seashells or lime stones under extreme temperature conditions of more than 800°C by undergoing decarbonation process of lime sources.

It starts the calcination process by using hot process gases from the rotary kiln to preheat the feed material prior to it entering the kiln. Its design allows for the hot gases to be drawn around the full circumference at the cassette level, entering the cassette equally on all sides before being drawn up through the descending stone.

## Effect of phosphatation and calcination on the  ScienceDirect
Phosphatation led to a drop in pH due to the addition of acid while the calcination process increases the pH. This rise of the pH is due to the decarbonation of calcite which produces lime ( Kribi, 2005 ). The pH values are respectively 6.9 and 10.3 for the sediments DA6P and DA6C.

Lime is manufactured by calcining (burning) highpurity calcitic or dolomitic limestone at temperatures ranging from 980° C to 1,320° C. It is never found in a natural state. The calcination process drives off the carbon dioxide, forming calcium oxide (quicklime). The subsequent addition of water creates calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime).

Lime is a calciumcontaining inorganic material composed primarily of oxides, and hydroxide, usually calcium oxide and/or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coalseam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The International Mineralogical Association recognizes lime as a mineral with the chemical formula of CaO.
