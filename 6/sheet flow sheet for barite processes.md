## Barite Mineral Uses and Properties Geology
Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy." This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral. The high specific gravity of barite makes it suitable for a wide range of industrial, medical, and

Blancfixe, a white coloring principle, obtained as a precipitate of barium sulphate (BaSO 4) from the Barite, is the natural ore of barium. It is also popularly known as heavy spar. Barytes or barite is a colorless or white mineral; often tinged with yellow, red, brown, and sometimes blue. The crystalline system is rhombic.
