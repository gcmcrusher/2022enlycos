## Batu Hijau CopperGold Mine Mining Technology
Batu Hijau is an openpit mine. Ore is transported to the primary crushers using P&H 4100 electric mining shovels and a fleet of 220tcapacity Caterpillar 793C mechanicaldrive haul trucks. The mine typically handles around 600,000t/d of ore and waste, the ore grading an average 0.49% copper and 0.39g/t gold.
