## GROUND CALCIUM CARBONATE Building Materials Carmeuse
Ground calcium carbonate used in the manufacturing of roofing, flooring, and other building materials. Ground calcium carbonate is often used to increase durability and reduce costs by displacing or "extending" other raw materials that are more expensive. It is the ideal raw material as it has low absorption qualities, consistent particle size distribution and color.
