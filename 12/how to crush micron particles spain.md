## Understanding Micron Levels and What They Have to do with  Aquasana
Micron levels in water filtration are usually between .5 and 5 microns. For example, if bacteria in your water are 1 micron and you have a filtration system with a micron level of 1; it will be able to filter out that bacteria (as well as anything larger than 1). However, any filter with a micron level greater than 1 will allow the bacteria to

You may also want to see how much coarse powder you have, so something around 60 micron would be useful to determine the material larger than that size. I would have 10, 20 and 60micron screens to separate the coarse and fine particles. If you want one additional size in the mix to better determine the mean, I would go with a 35micron screen.

Hydraulic fracturing is used in the oil and gas industry to increase the flow of oil and/or gas from a well. Proppants are pumped into the oil well with fracturing fluid to hold the fissures open. The proppant size, shape, and mechanical strength influences the integrity of the newly created fractures, and therefore the flow of oil and gas out of the well.

Additionally, most particles that invade a lubricant are very small. Small particles enter more easily than large particles. For instance, for each 10micron particle that ingresses into the oil, there may be ten 3micron particles. This smallparticle dominance is compounded further by filtration. Most machines with circulating oil have filters.
