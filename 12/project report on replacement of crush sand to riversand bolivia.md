## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction GreenFacts
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

## What is Fineness Modulus of Sand (Fine Aggregate) and Calculation
Fineness modulus of sand (fine aggregate) is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand. It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves. The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus. Fine aggregate means the aggregate which

The Civil engineers, Architects, Builders, and Contractors agree that the river sand, which is available today, is deficient in many respect. It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.

## Sand Unit Weight or Specific Weight Calculation Civil Engineering
Specific Weight or Unit weight of Sand. Unit weight or Specific Weight of sand is calculated by the product of the density of sand and the standard gravity of sand. According to the US customary measurement system, dry weighs 1.631 gram per cubic centimeter, this density is equal to 101.8 pounds per cubic foot [lb/ft³].
