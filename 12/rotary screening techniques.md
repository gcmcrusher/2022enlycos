## ScreenPrinting Process an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Screen printers will visually look at the printed textile sample and mix different base colors of ink to obtain the final color. This is done in a 'color kitchen' similar to mixing paint colors. A typical rotary screen printer can have from 1 to 12 spot colors and from 1 to 12 screens. Each color is mixed individually and is called a colorway.
