For downhill conveyors, continuous regenerative braking operation is typically required. Here, an Active Front End (AFE) drive or alternatively a regenerative drive panel solution, using a standard 6pulse drive with separate regenerative module, is the best solution to feed back energy when the conveyor runs downhill.
