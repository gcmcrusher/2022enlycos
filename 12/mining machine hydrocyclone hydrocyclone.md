Hydrocyclones first appeared in dutch in the late 1800s, Hidrociclon is an equipment that uses rotary current to classify, separate or sort coarse particles of sewage. It widely used in mine processing such as aggregates, hard rock mining, sand, industrial minerals, coal and more. Because the equipment without moving parts, take up small areas, process high volumes and relatively cheap.
