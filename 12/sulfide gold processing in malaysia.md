## Characterizing gold in refractory sulfide gold ores and residues
Gold is present in refractory sulfide gold ores mainly in arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite, where it occurs in both the chemically bonded state and as nanosize grains of metallic gold. During roasting or pressure oxidation, the sulfide matrix is destroyed and essentially all the gold is converted to the metallic form. The liberated gold is readily dissolved in conventional cyanide media

Sulfide gold ores account for a large proportion of refractory gold ores, therefore, it is very meaningful to recover gold from sulfide gold ores (Ubaldini and Vegliò, 2000, Saba, 2011, Hammerschmidt, 2016). Moreover, the major gold leaching process for extracting gold from ores and concentrates is still cyanide leaching.
