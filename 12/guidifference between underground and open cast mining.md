## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
There are two widely used ways of mining: strip mining and underground mining. Strip mining. Strip mining (also known as open cast, mountaintop or surface mining) involves scraping away earth and rocks to get to coal buried near the surface. In many cases, mountains are literally blasted apart to reach thin coal seams within, leaving permanent
