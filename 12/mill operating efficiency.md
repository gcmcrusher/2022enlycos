Horizontal stirred mills can be operated at higher media fillings (up to 85%), at higher agitator speeds (6–22 m/s) and at lower media size (1 mm). These characteristics of horizontal mills make them more energy efficient over the vertical configurations ( Gao et al., 2002, Clark, 2007 ). In addition to energy efficiency, the scalingup of

Maximum Efficiency of a Wind Turbine. Today's wind turbines can reach maximum values of Cp in the range of 0.45 to 0.50, which is 75–85% of the maximum theoretical value. If wind speeds are high and a turbine is running at its rated power, the turbine rotates (pitches) its blades to reduce Cp to avoid damage.
