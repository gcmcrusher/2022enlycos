## INTRODUCTION TO VIBRATION TECHNOLOGY
2. Amplitudes of machinery vibration are directly proportional to the amount of dynamic forces (loads) generated. If you double the force, you double the vibration. 3. Logically then, the lower the amount of generated dynamic forces, the lower the levels of machinery vibration and the longer the machine will perform before failure.
