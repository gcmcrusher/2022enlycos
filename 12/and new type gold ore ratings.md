## Minecraft 1.19 Ore Distribution Guide: How and Where to Find  Beebom
Putting an end to your anticipation, let's first go over where to find diamonds in Minecraft. In Minecraft 1.19, diamond ore generates below Y=16 world height only. From there, the deeper you go, the higher are the chances of coming across diamonds. With that logic, the height of Y=64 has the highest chance of spawning a deepslated diamond ore.

## Epithermal Gold Deposits Geology for Investors
Epithermal gold deposits are among the richest gold deposits in the world, with some bonanzagrade ore shoots containing more than 1000 g/t goldequivalent or a kilogram of gold for everyone tonne of rock mined. The tonnage of ore in epithermal veins is typically smaller than other types of lowgrade gold deposits.. Gold mineralisation within epithermal veins can occur over vertical intervals
