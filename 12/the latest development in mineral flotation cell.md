## Flotation: The Past, Present and Future of Mineral Processing?
As we look to the future, the mining industry faces a myriad of challenges. While demand for metals like copper, cobalt, lithium and iron ore is projected to reach record highs by 2050, ore grades are decreasing, orebodies are becoming more complex, and fewer tier 1 deposits are being discovered. As metal prices increase, lowergrade orebodies
