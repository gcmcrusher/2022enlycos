## Selection of an appropriate fan for an underground coal mine using the 
Ventilation is a vital process in underground mining operations. Fans are typically used in these ventilation systems to supply airflow to mines. Sufficient ventilation systems provide adequate fresh air to underground mines to ensure a safe working environment. Thus, the selection of an appropriate fan is an important part of mine ventilation.

One mine operated shuttle cars without hungry boards in a 2.6m seam because coal brushed off the car under the round ventilation tubes in about 10m of the 240m pillar sequence, and someone didn't like flat tubes. As a result the cars ran to the boot about 10% more often.

Coal mining deaths, for surface and underground mining combined, dropped from 20 in 2013 to 16 in 2014—the lowest number of coal mining deaths ever recorded annually in the United States. Of those 16, the majority (10) occurred in underground coal. Six of those occurred when the miner was either struck or pinned by mobile haulage equipment.
