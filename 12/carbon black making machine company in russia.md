## Synthetic diamond Wikipedia
After the 1797 discovery that diamond was pure carbon, many attempts were made to convert various cheap forms of carbon into diamond. The earliest successes were reported by James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879 and by Ferdinand Frédéric Henri Moissan in 1893. Their method involved heating charcoal at up to 3,500 °C (6,330 °F) with iron inside a carbon crucible in a furnace.

## Carbon Engineering Direct Air Capture of CO2 Home
Unlike capturing emissions from industrial flue stacks, our technology captures carbon dioxide (CO 2) – the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change – directly out of the air around us.This can help counteract today's unavoidable CO 2 emissions, and address the large quantities of CO 2 emitted in the past that remains trapped in our atmosphere.
