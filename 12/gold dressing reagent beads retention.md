## Evaluation of PVA/dextran/chitosan hydrogel for wound dressing
Crosslinking the PVA with other components could lead to hydrogel with different characteristics. Dextran, a complex glucan composed with α1,6 linkages, could be crosslinked with PVA to yield a wound dressing for better healing ability for dextran's traits in promoting angiogenic responses and enhancing complete skin regeneration during burn wound healing. 24 To elevate the applicability
