Starting from a crude ore assaying 45.6% Fe, a finegrained oolitic iron ore was concentrated by the oil agglomeration technique to 90% Fe recovery and 65% Fe assay. The ore required grinding to minus 5 μm to effect adequate liberation, and the technique yielded optimum results at pH 9. The roles of pH, collector, and bridging liquid

Iron ore is regarded as the second most important commodity behind oil. As an essential input for the production of crude steel, iron ore feeds the world's largest trilliondollarayear metal market and is the backbone of global infrastructure. To meet the growing demand for steel products, world iron ore production has increased

Iron Ore Agglomeration Technologies. Until the 1950s of the last century, the oxidized iron ores that were loaded into the blast furnace had granulometries within 10 and 120 mm. However, the depletion of highgrade iron ore sources has made necessary the utilization of concentration processes with the purpose of enriching the iron ore.
