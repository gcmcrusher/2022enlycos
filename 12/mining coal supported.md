1. Development process of anchor cable support. As early as 1890, the North Wales coal mine reinforcement project began to use steel bars to reinforce the rock. In 1911, the Bolting support technology was first used in the tunnel in Friedens Coal Mine in the United States. In 1918, the Silesian coal mine in the United States used the bolting

Coal Mining. According to the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals, 131.8 million tons of coal was mined in Kentucky in 2000; 62 percent (81 million tons) was from underground mines and 38 percent (50 million tons) was from surface mines. There were 264 active underground mines and 240 active surface mines in Kentucky in 2000.

Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In deep mining, the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping

Roof support at the face (the area where coal is actively mined) is intended to hold the immediate roof above the coal face. In modern mechanized mines, roof bolting is the most common method employed. Steel bolts, usually 1.2 to 2 metres long and 15 to 25 millimetres in diameter, are inserted in holes drilled into the roof by an electric rotary drill and are secured by either friction or resin.

In 1874, the first mineshaft in Cherokee County was dug and coal was excavated using the roomandpillar system in which substantial pillars of coal are left standing to support the overlying rock. Underground mining was dominant there for several decades, and the WeirPittsburg coal bed became the most extensively mined coal bed in Kansas history.
