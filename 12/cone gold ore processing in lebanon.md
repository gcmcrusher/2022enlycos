## Crushing and Grinding Wet & Sticky Ore Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A washing section is a "must" in all operations handling wet, sticky ore. This facilitates ore handling, crushing, and also affords a means for separation of primary slimes and increasing grinding capacity. These slimes usually contain the bulk of the soluble salts and in many cases this fraction should be treated separately or even

What is Lithium. Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4 O 10 (F,OH) 2, spodumene LiAl (SiO 3) 2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium.
