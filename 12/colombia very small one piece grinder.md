## How to evaluate a used surface grinder? Practical Machinist
As far as ways vs spindle ("pick one bad" ) I have rescraped a couple surface grinders and would prefer to rebuild a spindle any day. Most machinists have the tools or can make the incidental wrenchs, etc to do a spindle. You need a lot of expensive tools and some experience and a week to rescrape a small one. Ways bad leave it go.

QuantumCannabis 2 yr. ago. Check out a SpeedMixer. It grinds very evenly and destems in a few seconds. Additionally you could use it then to infuse your rosin onto the flower for a "caviar" type preroll. And when you get into c1d1 it can purge butane and propane in just a few minutes and then also whip it into badder/budder.

## Is the Brilliant Cut Grinder a good buy? : vaporents reddit
The unit itself feels extremely well made and is satisfying to use/operate. The grind is very consistent & smooth, and it doesn't gum up quickly. They pop on r/entexchange occasionally as well if you don't find a 420 deal on them. There's tons of Santa Cruz on there as well if you didn't wanna go with a BCG.
