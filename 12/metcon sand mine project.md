Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.
