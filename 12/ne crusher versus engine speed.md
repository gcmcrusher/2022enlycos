## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The highspeed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
