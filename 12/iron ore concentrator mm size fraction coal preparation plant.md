A coal preparation plant separates a low specific gravity clean coal fraction from a high specific gravity refuse fraction, and separately processes those fractions. Run of mine coal having particle sizes up to about 4 inches is mixed with a slurry of water and magnetizable particles, and is introduced into a heavy media cyclone to separate the high and low specific gravity fractions.

The partition curve for the minerals carrying alumina lies between those of iron and silica carriers. The recovery of 0.04 mm iron particles is close to 40% while this size fraction accounts for 12–17% of the iron contained in the spiral feed (Bazin et al., 2014). This low recovery of fine particles is partly responsible for the iron losses

Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.
