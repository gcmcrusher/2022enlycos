Viking Hammer Mill. Going to pick up a Viking Hammer mill in the morning. Looks to be in pretty fair shape and shouldnt be too hard to get it running. Does anyone have any pics of one or know what color it was? My son will be using it to grind feed and would like to repaint it and kind of restore it.

Historical Ties. If the plow was previously owned by someone notable, its value would increase. Usually, plows can get valued anywhere between $100 â€“ $700. Still, there was a time when a plow was sold for $10000 only because its previous owner was well known.
