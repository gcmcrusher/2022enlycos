## Six reasons that affect the service life of the hammer
A hammer with good impact hardening will have a longer service life. If the rotor speed is too low, not only the production capacity is low, but also the kinetic energy is low, resulting in poor impact hardening of the hammerhead and poor wear resistance. If the rotor speed is too high, although the hammerhead can obtain better impact hardening
