## What Is the Difference between CNC Milling and CNC Turning?
The result is a part that is accurate and repeatable. Milling and turning differ in very important ways, though. Milling removes material by advancing a tool that rotates incredibly fast into the stock material and the moving it along that CNCdetermined path. Imagine a drill moving towards a piece of wood. Turning, however, uses a lathe machine.
