Some ore types can be treated by crushing, grinding and mixing ore with water to produce slurry. The coppercontaining particles are then removed by a process called flotation. The product of this process is dry, gray powder called copper concentrate, which contains about 30 percent copper. The concentrated copper is sent by rail to a smelter

The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.
