Gold mine tailings contain high levels of toxic metals such as Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, As, and Hg with negative influence on plants. Several plants and bacteria have developed tolerance to the excess of Cu. Plants growing on Cupolluted sites appear to accumulate elevated concentrations of Cu, notably in the vicinity of industrial areas ( Fishelson et
