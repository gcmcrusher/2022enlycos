Burnt lime, as compared to limestone, improves the heat transfer in the sintered layer. At the same basicity and the same volume of fuel, a change in the CO 2 /CO ratio can occur, due to the different amounts of carbonates after their replacement by lime. For lime too, the quality, granulometry, quantity, and method of lime addition to the agglomeration process are critical to sinter

Sintering is arguably the most important step in the ceramics manufacturing process. It is the phase when the greenbody is fired at temperatures approaching the ceramic powder's melting point, causing the consolidated raw material to undergo numerous chemical and physical changes. Several distinct sintering methods exist, but each one essentially exploits the same properties of

Sintering is the process of using heat to turn powdered substances into solids without actually melting the material. Sintering allows production of parts without melting and liquid casting processes, i.e., dealing with only powder or fine sand. During sintering, the pressed parts move through a controlledatmosphere furnace.

Sintering is a heat treatment applied to a powder compact in order to impart strength and integrity. The temperature used for sintering is below the melting point of the major constituent of the Powder Metallurgy material. After compaction, neighbouring powder particles are held together by cold welds, which give the compact sufficient "green

## Sintering Process and Use of the Sintering Furnace
1. Sintering Process. Sintering: Heat treatment of the powder or compact at a temperature lower than the melting point of the main component aims to improve its strength through metallurgical bonding between particles. Packing material: A material in which the compact is embedded in order to separate and protect it during the presintering or sintering process.
