## Horizontal Milling Machines vs Vertical: The Differences Explained
Like vertical mills, horizontal milling machines feature a rotating spindle. Still, this spindle is mounted horizontally. The cutting tools used on these machine tools are typically shorter and thicker, often similar to the grinder wheel, instead of the long, thin end mills you would see on a vertical milling machine.
