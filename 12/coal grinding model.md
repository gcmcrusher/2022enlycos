Grinding Action is carried out by a series of hinged or fixed hammers revolving in an enclosed chamber with wearresistant plates. The hammers impact on the coal, crushing it against the plates. Further pulverization of coal is achieved as the smaller coal particles are ground through attrition against each other and the grinding face.
