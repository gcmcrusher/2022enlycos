The bottom of the Pennsylvania Crusher reversible impactor is open and the sized material passes through almost instantaneously. Liberal clearance between hammers and the breaker blocks eliminates attrition and crushing is by impact only. Pennsylvania Crusher single roll crushers reduce large input by a combination of shear, impact and compression.

## What Are The Reasons for The Large Vibration Amplitude of Hammer Crusher?
During the installation of the hammer crusher, the installation bearing of the main machine and the motor must be the same bearing. Otherwise, when the crusher works, the motor will not directly drive the main machine, resulting in large vibration amplitude of the equipment as a whole. 3. Deep cavity rotor imbalance.
