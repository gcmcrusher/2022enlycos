Gypsum improves the ability of soil to drain and not become waterlogged due to a combination of high sodium, swelling clay, and excess water (Aldrich and Schoonover 1951). Improvements of infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity with use of gypsum add to the ability of soils to have adequate drainage. 12.
