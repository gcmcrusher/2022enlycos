Mill your powders before mixing the formula to ensure a homogeneous particle size distribution. The ball mill produces impact and attrition between the material and the moving balls and is suitable for wet and dry grinding processes. Although it downsizes particles to very fine grades, it does not very well handle soft, fibrous materials.

Figure 8 shows the change in flake width of iron powder with milling time in a vibratory ball mill. Attrition grinding is most effective in fine grinding both hard and ductile materials and in mechanical alloying. In most ball mills, particles are subjected to both impact and attrition forces. When forces are highly energetic, welding may occur
