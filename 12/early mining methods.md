Bell Pit Mining. Bell pit mining was one of the early methods of underground mining. The name comes from the shape that the mine forms. A long narrow shaft is dug down until it reaches the coal seam. Once it reaches the seam, the coal is then mined laterally along the seam either side of the shaft, creating the bell shape.
