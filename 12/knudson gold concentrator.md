The Falcon Concentrator is a Fine Gold Recovery Equipment made of a rotating bowl with the smooth inclined wall. The feed slurry enters the bottom of the bowl and gets stratified along the bowl wall. The heavier material settles on the wall while the lighter particles are pushed to the lip of the bowl and discharged as the overflow.

The Knelson Concentrator is a compact hatch centrifugal separator with an active fluidized bed to capture heavy minerals. A centrifugal force up to 60 times that of gravity acts on the particles, trapping denser particles in a series of rings (riffles) located in the machine, while the lowdensity particles are flushed out.

The Consep Acacia Reactor is a complete intense leaching plant that maximises the recovery of gold from gravity concentrates. Often used downstream from FLSmidth Knelson Concentrators, the Acacia produces the optimum solidliquid interaction for maximised gold leaching kinetics by using an up flow fluidised reactor as opposed to complex mechanical agitation.

From the experimental results, with the increase of gravity value, the concentrate gold grade and recovery rate of Knelson gravity decreased. The lower gravity value is beneficial to Knelson to concentrate gold. When the gravity value is 40G, the grade of gold concentrate is 107.28 g/t, and the recovery rate is 67.49%. 【2.2.2 Fluidized water】.
