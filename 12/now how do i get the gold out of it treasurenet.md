## Where To Dredge?!? Gold Panning, Sluicing, Dredging, Drywashing, Etc 
Hi thank u. I am already a amra member. Anyone who mines or enjoys going out into our blm or fs land should donate to them. They really are fighting for our rights. They have many out of state claims, just not sure where to go. I'm picking the dredge up this week. I don't have time to run it to busy laying concrete!

Sorry to say that I do not use Whites detectors. I have a Tracker IV and a Nox 800 that I got from my grandfather. I am south of Springfield about 50 miles and get out there when I can. I also pan for gold in some of our creeks near here also. Good luck and good hunting.
