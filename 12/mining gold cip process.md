## Process Quality Management of Gold CIP Plant Explained Miningpedia
The process quality management of the gold CIP plant is an important part in the production of gold mines. It includes 7 aspects: raw ore management, crushing process quality management, grinding quality management, leaching adsorption quality management, desorption and electrowinning quality management, smelting quality management and tailings treatment quality management.

## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.
