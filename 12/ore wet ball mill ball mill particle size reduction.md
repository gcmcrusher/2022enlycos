## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid overgrinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

Wet Ball Mills are Ball Mills that are used widely in the ore beneficiation industry,as well as the building material industry such as glass.. During the producing phase, the material and water are mixed together to grind in the ball mill. Under the effect of the flowing water,the material will get a better flow ability so the processing capacity will be higher.
