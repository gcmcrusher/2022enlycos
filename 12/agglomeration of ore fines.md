In this process ore fines and concentrated are mixed with a suitable binder (lime or Petroleum bitumen) and fed into a double roll Briquetting process to be molded into shape. The agglomeration continues as the ore proceeds through the kiln and is heated at a temperature of 1200 to 1500 oC. A grate cooler usually cools the nodules.

Pellets around 410 mesh provide a happy medium between iron ore fines (crushed/ground iron ore) and a chunk of iron (mined) for use in a blast furnace. Pelletization offers an effective solution to the items noted above. The 'recipe' for successful pelletization, however, is determined through testing. Iron Ore Agglomeration Tests

Agglomeration Of Iron Ore Fines Process. For utilization of these fines, agglomeration techniques, such as sintering, pelletizing, or briquetting, are required. Sintering is the oldest, easiest, and energyefficient process to use these fines. Therefore, in most of the steel plant sintering routes are followed for using these undersize iron ore.

Sintering and pelletizing are the processes of major importance for the iron production. During 2014, as per World Steel Association, the production of blast furnace iron and direct reduced iron were 1183 million tons and 73 million tons respectively. Most of this production has come from iron ore in the form of sinter and pellet.

Crushed ore agglomeration has two major aims. First, it is the best opportunity for the thorough application of the leaching solution prior to building the heap and "kick starting" the leaching process itself ( Bouffard, 2005, Dhawan et al., 2012a, Kodali et al., 2011a, Purkiss and Anthony, 2004 ).
