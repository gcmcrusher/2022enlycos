It can substitute or support wet beneficiation in waterscarce areas. However, the final recovery depends on the liberation size, external contamination by way of stones, BHQ & also the fineness of iron ore. Since dry beneficiation can increase the Fe grade by 48% only, it is recommended to use original iron ore grades of more than 50% Fe.
