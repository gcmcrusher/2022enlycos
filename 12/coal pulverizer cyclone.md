CycloneFurnace Boilers. B&W developed Cyclone furnace technology to burn coal grades that are not wellsuited for pulverized coal combustion. The ash from these coals has a very low melting temperature. This molten ash would normally be deposited on all downstream heat transfer surfaces, causing severe slagging and fouling with resultant

## Cyclone Boiler an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Cyclone boilers burn crushed (but not pulverized) coal in large (e.g., 10ft dia.) cyclone barrels and send hot (e.g., 3200–3550°F or 1760–1950°C) gases into the furnace and then convective pass. Cyclone boilers are designed to maximize the production of slag from the inorganic constituents in fuel; inorganics are managed in this manner.

## Vertical Grinding Mill (Coal Pulverizer) Explained saVRee
Coal pulverizers are used to dry, grind and classify. Drying is achieved as hot gas passes through the pulverizer and removes moisture from the pulverized coal. The hot gases used should have a low oxygen content, this reduces the likelihood of accidental combustion within the mill. It is possible for hot gases to be taken directly from the

## AND PULVERIZED COAL FURNACE
AND PULVERIZED COAL FURNACE. The cyclone furnace is a watercooled horizontal cylinder (5 to 10 ft in diameter) into which coal is introduced. As the coal moves from front to rear, combustion air is introduced tangentially at high velocity and about 35in water gage pressure. This causes a whirling or centrifugal action, with the solid fuel
