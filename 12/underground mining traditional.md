## The impact of mining on sustainable practices and the traditional 
The traditional culture of the people living in the mining towns is fading away due to the large influence of mining in the lives of the local communities. The families in these areas used to depend on farming and fishing to sustain their daily needs, but due to the money generated from mining, they are mostly dependent on mining activities.

Surface mining. Surface mining（ground mining） is a type of mining in which the soil and rock covering the mineral deposit are removed instead of underground mining, in which the overlying stones are left in place. Surface miner machine（surface mining machines） is essential. The surface mining process is very complicated.

## Traditional mining Wikipedia
Traditional mining, also known as oldschool mining, is a mining method involving the use of simple manual tools, such as shovels, pickaxes, hammers, chisels and pans. [1] It is done in both surface and underground environments. Until the early 1900s, traditional mining was widely used throughout the world.

Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land, or overburden, above the seams.This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground.
