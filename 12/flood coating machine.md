## Rod Coating vs. Flood Coating askralph
In my opinion rod coating is more effective and accurate than flood coating. Rod coating provides a very wide coating weight range. They also allow much greater precision in coating weight control and are typically much easier to operate. The rod coating process also provides superior cross machine coating uniformity as compared to flood coating.
