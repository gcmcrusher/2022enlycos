The size that the crusher will reduce the rock to is determined by the gap between the liner and the mantle. This gap is adjusted by moving the bowl liner away from the mantle. The closer to the mantle the smaller the gap. The bowl liner is adjusted the same way that a nut is put onto a bolt. The liner is turned on a set of threads.
