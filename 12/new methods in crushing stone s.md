## [Preliminary summarization of a new method, extrinsic shock wave 
In medical field, extrinsic shock wave is only used to crush kidney stone to pieces. In recent years, a new instrument has been produced, which outputs a more gentle extrinsic shock wave that also can be used for treatment of pain excitation region in the muscular system. This shock wave is called rectilinear ballistic extrinsic shock wave.
