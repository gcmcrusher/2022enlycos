The housing of a work roll or backup roll bearing is known as roll chock or simply chock. Chock is the basic part of a rolling mill. It is mounted in the window of the roll stand housing between the posts with a small clearness. The roll stand housing encloses and supports the chock assembly. The chock also prevents scale getting into the roll

In this configuration, there are two horizontally mounted rolls. The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the work piece.

1. Establish vertical and horizontal centerline of mill and pinion shaft against the effects of this, we recommend that the trunnion bearing sole plate be crowned so as to be higher at the center line of the mill. This is done by using a higher shim at the center than at the ends and tightening the foundation bolts of both ends. Ball Mill Sole

The Milling Process – Definitions Cutting speed,v c Indicates the surface speed at which the cutting edge machines the workpiece. Effective or true cutting speed, v e Indicates the surface speed at the effective diameter (DC ap).This value is necessary for determining the true cutting data at the actual depth of cut (a p).This is a particularly important value when using round insert cutters

## Understanding tangential cutting force when milling
Torque (T s) that is applied to the spindle, and therefore to the milling cutter, is generated by the tangential cutting force (F t) and can be calculated by the formula: T s = F t × R (1) Where R is a radius of a milling cutter. (Formulas are referenced later by the number in parentheses.) The concept of calculating tangential cutting force

A new concept of calculating the required machining power when milling. Courtesy of Walter. Walter's F 4041 shoulder milling cutter. The conventional method of calculating required machining power (Pr) is based on the metalremoval rate, measured in in.3/min. (cm3/min.), and the average unit power requirements (Pm), measured in hp/in.3/min. (kW/cm3/min.).
