A rareearth mineral contains one or more rareearth elements as major metal constituents. Rareearth minerals are usually found in association with alkaline to peralkaline igneous complexes, in pegmatites associated with alkaline magmas and in or associated with carbonatite intrusives. Perovskite mineral phases are common hosts to rareearth elements within the alkaline complexes.
