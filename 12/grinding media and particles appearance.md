To obtain the longest service life of the grinding beads and sand mills, it is best to use resin for cleaning and maintain sufficient material viscosity during the production process. First, identify the appearance of "broken beads". If the particles are more round and not sharp (like broken glass pieces), they are naturally worn beads.
